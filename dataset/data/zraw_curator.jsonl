But the key part is that these skills are useful not just at the current company, but in the broader industry. If a worker gains skills that are highly valued by other firms, their market value increases. From a purely self-interested point of view, the worker could then demand a higher wage to stay, or leave for a better offer elsewhere. The company paid for the training, but if the worker leaves or demands a significantly higher salary, the company might not fully benefit from that investment. It seems like they're paying to make their workers more attractive to competitors. That feels like a risky investment if the only factor is productivity and wages.\n</think>\nFrom a traditional economic perspective, employers might be hesitant to fund training that provides skills easily transferable to other companies. The concern is that once trained, workers become more attractive to competitors and could either demand higher wages to reflect their increased market value or leave for better opportunities elsewhere.

There could be a non-monetary aspect, something about motivation or willingness to contribute in less formal ways.\n</think>\nThe traditional focus on wage renegotiation and turnover might be incomplete. It's possible that employers invest in general training because it influences worker behavior through channels beyond just increased productivity and wages.

These are things that are valuable to a company's long-term success and reputation, but you can't put them in a contract because they're hard to define, observe, or measure precisely. You can't tie them directly to pay. This kind of effort, done out of goodwill or internal motivation, might be influenced by how the employer treats the worker, like providing training. Because it's hidden or unobservable, it's hard for the company to track and reward directly, and hard for researchers to study in real-world settings.\n</think>\nThis points to the concept of discretionary effort \u2013 voluntary actions workers take that go beyond their formal job requirements. These contributions, such as helping others, promoting the company, or taking initiative, are valuable for the firm's overall well-being but are non-contractible because they are difficult for the employer to observe, verify, or measure precisely.

A larger investment (more training) might generate a stronger positive feeling or a greater sense of reciprocity. So, it seems plausible that the level of discretionary effort they're willing to exert could increase as the amount of training they receive increases. It's like returning a favor, but in the form of unasked-for effort.\n</think>\nIt seems plausible that the level of discretionary effort a worker is willing to exert might be positively correlated with the amount of general training received.

A reciprocal response (like increased discretionary effort) might be stronger in that case because the intention behind the training feels more direct and benevolent. If the training happened for reasons outside the employer's direct control (like a regulation), the worker still benefits from the skills, but the same sense of personal investment or 'gift' from the employer might be weaker.

Understanding this negative aspect is probably important for employers too \u2013 maybe providing training isn't just about gaining positive benefits, but also about avoiding negative consequences from unhappy workers.\n</think>\nIt's conceivable that just as workers might exert effort to benefit the firm, they could also exert effort to harm it, particularly if they feel unfairly treated or perceive a lack of investment from the employer.

And finally, some wood is processed into paper products \u2013 paper manufacturing. These seem like the core industries. To understand their economic health and impact, we'd need to look at standard economic measures. How many people are employed? What are they earning (wages)? How much are they producing (output)? How many businesses are operating? And how does the price of their products change?

Also, economic time series often don't just randomly jump around; they might have underlying trends or long-term relationships. If variables are tied together in the long run (cointegration), a simple forecast model might be misleading. We need something that can capture these interdependencies, account for long-term relationships, and model how a shock in one variable might affect the others over time. A modeling framework that handles multiple variables that are potentially cointegrated seems appropriate. A Vector Error Correction (VEC) model is a type of model designed for just this kind of situation.\n</think>\nForecasting interconnected economic variables that likely have long-term relationships requires a sophisticated time series modeling approach.

Another issue is missing variables that are theoretically important but hard to measure, like investment in new equipment or technology (capital), which definitely affects production and jobs. Also, these models forecast based on historical patterns; they might struggle to predict the impact of totally unexpected events, like a major economic crash or a global pandemic. And fitting these models usually needs a decent amount of historical data, so if data series are short, that could be a limitation.\n</think>\nSeveral challenges might arise, primarily related to data. Obtaining consistent, high-frequency (e.g., quarterly) data for all necessary variables (employment, wages, output, price, number of firms) specifically at the state level for narrow industry classifications can be difficult. Proxies might be needed for some variables. Furthermore, key theoretical variables like capital investment, which significantly impact industry dynamics, may not have readily available data at this granularity.

Packaging paper might be different, though. So, I might intuitively expect the logging sector's future to be somewhat tied to the overall wood demand, which might fluctuate but maybe not face the same fundamental, long-term pressure as some parts of the paper industry. Paper manufacturing, at least in traditional segments, seems more likely to face contraction. This could mean different outlooks for jobs, the number of mills, and overall production between the two sectors.\n</think>\nIntuitively, I might expect contrasting trends between the logging and paper manufacturing sectors. Logging, as the raw material supplier, is influenced by overall demand for wood across various uses (lumber, pulp, energy). While demand for different wood products changes, the fundamental need for timber might remain relatively stable or shift in focus. Paper manufacturing, particularly for print and communication papers, appears more vulnerable to long-term decline due to substitution by digital media.

The cell membrane is an insulator surrounded by conductive medium. When you apply an external field, charge builds up across the membrane. The text hints at a relationship where the potential across the membrane (transmembrane potential) depends on the cell's diameter and the angle relative to the field. If the transmembrane potential is higher in larger cells for the same external field strength, and it's this potential that causes the membrane damage (electroporation), then a higher potential means a higher chance of damage.

But as the larger cells are removed, the remaining population shifts towards smaller, more resistant cells. The rate of death slows down. Plotting the surviving fraction over time on a log scale would start steeper and then flatten out. This would create a curve that is concave upwards. This shape sounds similar to what the Weibull distribution can describe, particularly when its shape parameter is less than 1. So, the model might show that a simple size distribution alone can produce the kind of non-first-order, upward-concave curves seen in experiments.\n</think>\nA simplified computational model incorporating a distribution of cell diameters, where larger cells are more susceptible, would likely predict a survival curve that is concave upwards when plotted on a logarithmic scale.

'Tau' seems like an effective time scale for inactivation. If we increase the electric field strength, we'd expect cells to be killed faster overall, regardless of their size. So, 'tau' should decrease as field strength increases. What about the distribution width (Delta)? If the distribution is narrow, all cells are similar, approaching first-order kinetics (n=1). If it's wide, there's a bigger range of susceptibilities, leading to a more pronounced upward concavity (lower n). So, increasing distribution width should decrease 'n'. The field strength itself might also influence 'n' \u2013 perhaps at very high fields, even small cells are killed quickly, reducing the differential killing effect, or maybe it exaggerates it. The text suggests 'n' is sensitive to both field and width, while 'tau' is mainly sensitive to field.\n</think>\nBased on a model incorporating cell size distribution, the parameters of a fitted Weibull distribution would likely respond differently to changes. The time parameter ('tau') which represents the overall inactivation speed, would probably decrease significantly as the electric field intensity increases, as cells are generally killed faster at higher fields.

The common way to look at this is just to see if people have a septic tank or are connected to a sewer system, maybe using something like the sanitation ladder. But what if the systems they have don't actually *work* properly? A septic tank is useless if it's constantly backing up or leaching sewage into the yard. Just counting the tanks doesn't tell us about the lived experience or the actual environmental impact.\n\nSo, we need a more nuanced approach. How do we measure 'performance' and 'risk' beyond just presence? We could start by asking the residents themselves. What problems do they face day-to-day? Are toilets flushing? Are drains slow? Do they experience backups? How often? This 'user experience' perspective seems critical. We could capture this through surveys, asking about frequency of problems, severity (partial vs. full backups), and their overall satisfaction.\n\nBut just asking about problems isn't enough. How do people cope when systems fail? Do they try to fix things themselves? 'Self-maintenance' could be a significant factor, maybe preventing some backups but potentially exposing them to raw sewage directly. This is an aspect that might be completely missed by standard surveys or engineering checks. We should ask about the type and frequency of maintenance, both professional and informal. This adds another layer to understanding the 'burden' of a failing system, not just the failure itself.\n\nThen there's the environmental side. When a system fails \u2013 say, a septic system is leaking or a straight pipe is discharging \u2013 where does the waste go? It doesn't just disappear. It can pool in yards, flow into ditches, and eventually reach streams or other local water bodies. How do we track this? We could sample standing water on properties or in nearby environmental locations (creeks, public spaces). What should we test for? We'd need indicators of fecal contamination. Things like certain viruses that are common in human waste but not necessarily harmful themselves (like a specific pepper virus or tomato virus) could serve as 'trackers'. We should also look for actual pathogens (like norovirus) and chemical indicators of pollution (like chemical oxygen demand or nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus). This environmental data would provide objective evidence of contamination and show how far it might spread, confirming the risks suggested by the user reports.\n\nBy integrating the user-reported data (frequency of backups, maintenance practices, satisfaction) with the environmental data (contaminants in water samples), we can build a much richer picture. We can see if areas with high reported failures also show high contamination levels. We can investigate if certain system types or maintenance practices are associated with specific contamination patterns. This combined approach seems essential to truly understand the multifaceted nature of the problem \u2013 it's not just about lacking a system, it's about having a system that fails, impacts daily life, requires potentially risky coping behaviors, and contaminates the surrounding environment. This level of detail is necessary to inform effective solutions.\n</think>\nUnderstanding sanitation system performance requires integrating resident experiences, such as the frequency of system backups and the burden of informal maintenance practices, with environmental measurements of wastewater contamination.

The traditional way of digitizing them, scanning manually, is just incredibly slow and expensive. We're talking about millions of images, potentially. A human worker scanning one by one, even with a fast scanner, is going to take a very long time for an entire archive. This bottleneck prevents large-scale digitization projects from even being practical.\n\nSo, the idea is to bring in automation. Robots are great at repetitive tasks, they don't get tired, and they can potentially work around the clock. Could a robot scan these photographs? That seems like a promising direction to dramatically increase throughput.\n\nBut these aren't just standard documents. They are historical photographs, some are quite old, and they might be fragile. They could be curled, have peeling emulsion, dirt, or even mold. A simple automated feeder like you'd use for scanning office paper probably won't work. You can't just shove these through a scanner or a standard robot gripper. There's a real risk of damaging irreplaceable historical artifacts if the handling isn't extremely gentle and precise.\n\nThis suggests a purely automated system that handles everything from start to finish might be too complex or too risky given the condition of some of the materials. Maybe the task needs to be broken down. What if humans handle the delicate, complex tasks that require judgment and dexterity, like assessing the condition of each print, cleaning off mold or silver dust, trying to flatten curled prints without cracking the emulsion, or putting very fragile ones in protective sleeves? These are tasks that require visual inspection and careful manipulation \u2013 things humans are still much better at than robots.\n\nThen, once the prints are prepared and relatively stable, perhaps a robot could take over the highly repetitive job of actually placing the print on the scanner bed, initiating the scan, and moving it to an output stack. This hybrid approach, a collaboration between human preservationists and scanning robots, seems more realistic. The humans handle the 'preservation pipeline,' and the robots handle the 'scanning pipeline.'\n\nWhat are the specific technical challenges in this hybrid model? For the robot, designing an end-of-arm tool that can reliably pick up a single photograph, even if it's slightly warped or sticking to another, without damaging it is critical. It would need sensors to confirm it has a single sheet and perhaps vacuum or very gentle gripping mechanisms. It also needs to place the print accurately on the scanner bed every time so the scan is correctly framed and in focus across the whole image.\n\nIntegrating the robot with the scanner is another piece. The robot needs to know when the scanner is ready, signal the scanner to start, and know when the scan is complete so it can remove the print. Automating the scanner lid operation would be necessary for continuous robot operation.\n\nThe speed of the robot moving and positioning the print might become the new bottleneck, even if the scanner itself is fast. We'd need to optimize the robot's movements. To maximize the robot's potential, maybe one robot could serve multiple scanners, loading one while another is scanning.\n\nWhat about the quality of the digital output? Will the robot placement introduce artifacts? Will the automated system consistently achieve the required resolution and tonal accuracy? We'd need a way to verify the quality of the scanned images, possibly through automated checks and human review. Any errors like dust, folds, or misalignments could ruin a scan and require a rescan.\n\nAlso, implementing robotic systems requires significant upfront investment in hardware (robots, scanners, custom tooling, control systems). Is this approach cost-effective for any size of archive? Or is there a minimum scale where the investment pays off compared to manual scanning? It feels like it would only be worthwhile for very large collections where the sheer volume of work justifies the automation costs.\n\nSo, the feasibility hinges on successfully designing the delicate robotic handling, integrating it reliably with the scanning hardware, ensuring the automated process maintains high image quality, and confirming that the large upfront cost is offset by the massive productivity gains when applied to a very large archive. There are definitely engineering and logistical hurdles to overcome.\n</think>\nDeveloping a robot-assisted system for digitizing historical photographs faces several key feasibility challenges. A major consideration is designing robotic manipulators gentle enough to handle potentially fragile and damaged prints without causing further deterioration. This necessitates a hybrid approach where skilled human workers perform crucial preservation tasks like cleaning and flattening before automated scanning. Technical hurdles include creating reliable robotic end-effectors that can pick individual prints consistently, integrating robot control with scanner operation, optimizing movement speed, and ensuring the automated process maintains high image quality without introducing artifacts. While promising for achieving high throughput, the significant upfront investment implies this approach is likely only cost-effective for very large archives, requiring careful consideration of scale.", "role": "assistant"}], "entry_type": "single-long", "categories": ["eess.IV", "cs.SY", "econ.GN", "eess.SY", "q-fin.EC"], "avg_thinking_tokens": 867.0, "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"}

Only when K is above Kc does the virus establish and spread, leading to a significant infected population. So, K acts as a threshold factor determining if the environment can *support* the endemic spread of the disease.\n</think>\nanswer: The carrying capacity (K) represents the environmental resources supporting the mouse population size. The model includes a critical carrying capacity (Kc); if K is below Kc, the environment does not support the sustained spread of the virus, and the infection essentially dies out in the model.

If K is always below Kc during both the dry and rainy seasons individually, neither season on its own would predict an outbreak. The hypothesis is that it's the *switching* between these seasons that matters. When conditions switch, the mouse population starts to adjust towards the equilibrium state of the new season. However, if the season ends *before* the population can fully settle into that equilibrium (which, in our premise, would be an infection-free state because K<Kc), the population is caught in transition. It's this *interruption* of the relaxation to equilibrium, driven by the rapid switching, that might keep the population in a non-equilibrium state where the virus *can* spread, even though the conditions *within* either season wouldn't allow it if sustained.\n</think>\nanswer: The hypothesis is that seasonal alternation can induce outbreaks not because either season individually supports the disease (since K is below the critical threshold Kc in both), but because the population is constantly being pushed towards a new equilibrium as seasons change. If the duration of each season is too short relative to the time it takes the population to reach equilibrium, the relaxation process is interrupted, preventing the population from settling into the infection-free state predicted for static conditions below Kc.

One is set by the external environment: the duration of each season (let's call it the external timescale). The other is an internal property of the mouse population dynamics: how quickly the susceptible and infected populations change and settle towards a stable number after the environmental conditions (parameters like K, birth/death rates) change. This is the population's relaxation time. If the external timescale (season length) is much *longer* than the internal relaxation time, the population has plenty of time to reach the equilibrium of each season. But if the external timescale is *shorter* than the relaxation time, the population never settles before the next season starts, and the constant switching keeps it away from the predicted equilibrium states. This mismatch is where the outbreak might occur.\n</think>\nanswer: The phenomenon seems to arise from the competition between two timescales: the external timescale, which is the duration of each season, and the internal timescale, which is the characteristic relaxation time it takes for the mouse populations (susceptible and infected) to approach equilibrium after a change in environmental conditions.

Potential energy is related to the interactions between the atoms or molecules. As temperature changes, these interactions might change. If the polymer is in a more ordered or compact state at lower temperatures, the attractive forces might be stronger, leading to lower potential energy. As it heats up and becomes more disordered or expands, the distances between molecules might increase, weakening these attractive forces, and thus increasing the potential energy.

A measure like the radius of gyration, which describes the average size of a polymer coil, could be useful. If the polymer transitions from a compact state to a more expanded state, the radius of gyration should increase. Also, thinking about thermodynamics, how does the system absorb heat? The specific heat capacity (how much energy is needed to raise the temperature by a degree) might change significantly during a phase transition, reflecting the energy being used to rearrange the structure rather than just increasing kinetic energy.

It tells us how much energy is required to raise the temperature of the material. When a substance is undergoing a phase transition (like melting or boiling), the energy added is used to change the state (break bonds, increase disorder) rather than just increasing the temperature. This means that during a transition, the specific heat capacity often shows a peak or a sharp change. For our polymer melt, if there's a transition temperature where the polymer chains start to drastically change their arrangement or mobility, adding heat at that point would go into facilitating that change.

We expect *something* to happen around a certain temperature \u2013 maybe it goes from a more ordered, \"solid-like\" state to a less ordered, \"liquid-like\" or \"unfolded\" state. This sounds like a phase transition.\n\nHow do we even *define* a phase transition? In thermodynamics, transitions often show up as sharp changes in properties like heat capacity. If the heat capacity (C_V or C_P) shows a distinct peak at a certain temperature, that's usually a strong indicator of a first-order transition, where the system absorbs latent heat to change phase. If the change is smoother, maybe it's a higher-order transition or just a gradual change. So, measuring the heat capacity as a function of temperature seems like a primary way to identify and characterize the transition computationally. We could probably calculate heat capacity from fluctuations in total energy in our simulations - I think there's a relation between the variance of energy and heat capacity, derived from the partition function in statistical mechanics.\n\nBesides thermodynamic indicators like heat capacity, we also need to look at the *structure* of the system. What does the \"ordered\" state look like, and what does the \"disordered\" state look like? We need some way to quantify this structural order. Maybe we can define some \"order parameters\" that capture the relevant structural features. For example, if it's a chain or molecule, maybe something related to how compact or extended it is, like the average radius of gyration (R_g). Or if there are specific bonds or angles that change during the transition, maybe some measure of how many of those are in their \"native\" configuration compared to \"non-native\" configurations. We could track these order parameters and R_g as temperature increases in our simulations. If they show a sharp change around the same temperature where the heat capacity peaks, that would strongly support a first-order transition. If they change more gradually, it might suggest a different type of transition or just a continuous change.\n\nWe'll be using simulations, which involve sampling from the system's energy landscape based on temperature. We have this total potential energy function which is a sum of different terms \u2013 stretching bonds, bending angles, twisting (torsion), and interactions between parts of the system (native and non-native). How these different energy components contribute might tell us *what* is happening during the transition. For instance, if the non-native interaction energy suddenly increases around the transition temperature, it might mean the system is opening up and interacting with itself in new ways. If the torsion energy changes sharply, maybe it's related to uncoiling or twisting.\n\nSo, the plan would be to run simulations at different temperatures, calculate the total energy, kinetic energy (which gives us temperature), and potential energy components. From the energy fluctuations, we can get the heat capacity. Simultaneously, we can calculate structural metrics like R_g and our chosen order parameters. Plotting these quantities versus temperature should reveal if there's a transition, what temperature it occurs at (T_m, maybe?), and what its nature might be (sharp peak in C_V and abrupt change in order parameters suggesting first-order, or smoother changes). Comparing the contributions of different potential energy terms might give us insight into the specific structural rearrangements involved.\n\nThis approach, combining thermodynamic indicators derived from energy fluctuations with structural measures, seems like a solid way to probe the transition computationally and connect it back to the system's underlying mechanics described by the potential energy function.\n</think>\nTo characterize the system's temperature-induced transition, we can use computational simulations to calculate thermodynamic properties like heat capacity from energy fluctuations. A sharp peak in the heat capacity as temperature increases would suggest a first-order transition. Complementary to this, we can monitor structural metrics, such as the average radius of gyration and specific order parameters derived from the system's geometric configuration. Abrupt changes in these structural metrics coinciding with a heat capacity peak would further indicate a sharp transition, providing insight into the structural rearrangement occurring.

Standard simulations, even with powerful computers, are usually too slow to see these rare, long-duration events happening naturally, especially for complex proteins. They tend to get stuck in one stable shape. We need methods that can explore the dynamics on much longer timescales.\n\nThere are existing ways to try and speed things up or guide the simulation, like trying to find just one \"best\" path between shapes, or using biased forces to push the protein along. But these methods have limitations \u2013 they might miss alternative routes the protein could take, or they might not accurately reflect the real, unbiased dynamics. What I really want is to see the full range of possibilities, all the different ways the protein could transition, and if it pauses in any stable shapes along the way.\n\nMy intuition is that maybe we don't need *all* the atomic detail to capture the *large-scale* motions. Proteins are connected chains, and their overall movement is governed by the fundamental physics of these connections and basic repulsions/attractions, maybe not every single atom's interaction. So, what if we simplify the protein representation? Maybe just model each amino acid as a single bead. This significantly reduces the number of particles and interactions we have to track.\n\nBut even with fewer particles, the simulation time step might still be limited by the fastest motions, and calculating forces or energies repeatedly is costly. How can we make the simulation itself faster? I've seen work where people put particles on a grid instead of letting them move freely in continuous space. If the grid is fine enough \u2013 much smaller than the particle size \u2013 it should still behave almost like continuous space, but it allows pre-calculating and storing interaction energies for all possible nearby grid positions. This could drastically speed up the energy calculation step.\n\nSo, the idea is to combine these two: a simplified, bead-based protein model and a fast grid-based simulation technique. Can this combination actually work for seeing structural transitions?\nTo make the protein switch between known shapes (like a 'calcium-free' state and a 'calcium-bound' state), the simplified model needs to be designed to make *both* shapes stable. A standard model might just collapse to one favorite shape. Maybe we can use interactions that are based on the contacts the residues make in *both* of the desired shapes. If a pair of residues is close in one shape but far in the other, maybe that interaction should contribute differently than if they are close in both. This suggests a way to build a potential energy function that rewards both the 'calcium-free' and 'calcium-bound' configurations. Let's try a potential where contacts found in either target structure are favorable.\n\nIf we implement this simplified model with dual-state stabilization and simulate it on a fine grid using a dynamics method like Monte Carlo (which should approximate Brownian motion), what might we observe?\nGiven the simplification, I might worry it's *too* simple and won't show realistic behavior. But if the model captures the essential connectivity and spatial constraints, maybe it *is* enough to see the big movements.\nI would hope that with this increased speed, we can run the simulation long enough to see the protein actually transition from one shape to the other, unbiased. If it does transition, does it always take the same path? Or do different simulations show different routes? Do we see it pausing in shapes that are somewhere in between the start and end points? These pauses could represent stable intermediate states.\n\nIf we can indeed observe transitions, multiple pathways, and intermediates, it would be a strong indication that this simplified, grid-based approach is powerful enough to study the fundamental dynamics of these large-scale changes. It wouldn't give us atomic-level details, but it could provide crucial insights into the overall process, the sequence of events, and whether certain intermediate shapes are kinetically important. It could also serve as a valuable tool for understanding what makes these transitions happen and testing more complex simulation methods.\n</think>\nBy combining a simplified protein model that stabilizes multiple target structures with an efficient simulation method based on a fine grid, it appears possible to overcome the timescale limitations of conventional simulations and observe large-scale structural transitions in proteins.

It seems unlikely that every region behaves exactly the same way. The national economy surely plays a big role, lifting or lowering prices broadly. But what about places that have very specific characteristics? What if a region is heavily dependent on a particular industry, like mining? If that industry is booming, with lots of investment and jobs, one might hypothesize that demand for housing in that specific area would surge, potentially driving prices up much faster than the national average. Conversely, if the mining industry then faces a downturn, job losses could follow, and demand for housing might dry up, leading to price stagnation or even sharp declines, contrasting strongly with areas not tied to mining.\n\nThen there are regions that are particularly attractive places to live, maybe because of natural beauty, coastal location, or perceived quality of life. Let's call these 'lifestyle' regions. These areas might attract people from other places, perhaps from larger, more expensive cities. If prices in the cities rise significantly, people might gain enough equity or find it relatively more affordable to move to or buy property in these lifestyle areas. This could potentially trigger periods of increased demand and price growth in the lifestyle regions, perhaps lagging behind the initial city booms as people take time to make the move, but then catching up rapidly. This influx wouldn't necessarily be tied directly to the local economy of the lifestyle region itself, but rather to the economic conditions and housing markets elsewhere.\n\nSo, I'm thinking there might be distinct patterns or 'trends' in house prices that are linked to these specific regional characteristics \u2013 a 'mining trend' with its own cycles of boom and bust, and a 'lifestyle trend' perhaps linked to migration dynamics driven by affordability shifts relative to urban centers. These would operate on top of or alongside a general 'national trend' reflecting broader economic conditions.

This suggests an iterative approach. Start with initial guesses for the weights (maybe all equal). Run the simulation using these weights and build a histogram of visited energies. If some energies were visited too often (histogram peak), we know our weight for that energy was too high, so we reduce it for the next try. If some were visited too rarely (histogram dip), our weight was too low, so we increase it. We keep refining the weights based on the histogram from the previous run until the histogram of visited energies is roughly flat.\n</think>\nSince the exact density of states required for perfect flat sampling is initially unknown, the process is typically implemented iteratively.

Based on this histogram, the weights for the next iteration are adjusted \u2013 increasing weights for energies that were undersampled and decreasing them for energies that were oversampled.

Mayaki"], "paper_published_date": "2025-03-28", "paper_updated_date": "2025-03-28", "conversations": [{"content": "How might incomplete information and a firm's inherent characteristics, like its size or access to market details, influence its ability to maintain stable, cooperative behavior with competitors across multiple markets, even when there's a strong incentive to compete aggressively for short-term gain?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<think>\nOkay, let's think about this scenario: We have a couple of large companies, let's call them conglomerates, operating in more than one market. In theory, they could really go after each other aggressively on pricing to try and steal market share. If they both do that, though, they'll likely drive prices down to a point where neither of them is making much profit. This seems like a classic situation where individual self-interest (aggressively competing) leads to a worse outcome for the group (both firms). There's an incentive for each firm to defect from a more cooperative stance because they fear the other firm will defect first, leaving them vulnerable.\n\nBut what if they could somehow implicitly agree not to compete too fiercely? This kind of self-restraint, or 'forbearance,' could potentially lead to a more stable situation where both firms are better off in the long run. It feels like this tacit cooperation is key to avoiding that negative cycle of aggressive price wars.\n\nNow, introduce incomplete information. What if these firms don't know everything about each other or the markets they operate in? Maybe they don't know the other firm's true costs, or their exact strategy, or how susceptible they are to market changes. This uncertainty makes maintaining that forbearance really tricky. If I'm one of the firms, and I'm not sure my competitor is going to stick to the cooperative approach, I might be more inclined to preemptively become aggressive just to protect myself. Incomplete information seems like it would generally make stable cooperation harder to achieve and maintain.\n\nSo, how do firm characteristics play into this, especially under that cloud of incomplete information? Consider the size or resources (let's call them 'endowments') of a firm. A larger firm, or one with more resources, might be better equipped to handle the risk of its competitor defecting. If a price war does break out, a well-endowed firm might be able to sustain losses for longer than a smaller firm. This ability to weather a potential storm might make that larger firm more credible in its commitment to forbearance. The competitor might see this and be less likely to risk aggressive action because they know the larger firm can retaliate effectively and survive. So, firm size seems potentially important for enabling stable cooperation by providing a buffer against risk.\n\nWhat about a firm's access to market information or its overall level of 'information asymmetry'? If a firm has better internal systems, monitors the market more effectively, or just has better insights than its competitor, how does that impact things? This better information could reduce uncertainty for *that* firm. It might allow them to predict the competitor's actions more accurately, or to verify if the competitor is adhering to the tacit agreement. This reduced uncertainty *for the informed firm* could potentially make them more confident in maintaining forbearance. It might also give them an advantage in understanding the market dynamics that affect both firms. A higher overall level of incomplete information in the market, where both firms are largely in the dark, seems like it would significantly destabilize any attempt at cooperation.\n\nWhat about firm age? Does being older or more established matter? Perhaps older firms have built up a reputation for strategic consistency, making their behavior more predictable. Or maybe they've learned from past interactions how costly aggressive competition can be. This experience and reputation could potentially act as a signal that helps overcome some of the challenges of incomplete information, making stable forbearance more likely.\n\nSo, putting it together, it seems like the ability of firms to maintain stable, mutually beneficial cooperation in competitive multi-market settings, especially when they don't have perfect information, is likely tied to fundamental firm attributes. Larger, better-resourced firms may have the necessary resilience. Firms with better access to information or operating in less opaque environments may face less uncertainty. And maybe even experience or reputation from being established for a while plays a role. These factors could act as anchors that help firms resist the temptation to compete aggressively and instead settle into a more stable, cooperative pattern, despite the inherent dilemma and the fog of incomplete information.\n</think>\nMaintaining stable, cooperative behavior (forbearance) between competing firms in multi-market settings is challenging, particularly under incomplete information where the incentive to defect is high. A firm's characteristics appear crucial in navigating this dilemma. Larger, more resource-rich firms may be better able to absorb the risks of potential competitive conflict, making their commitment to forbearance more credible. Similarly, firms with less information asymmetry or better access to market details can reduce uncertainty, potentially fostering more stable cooperation. Firm age might also contribute through accumulated experience or established reputation.\n", "role": "assistant"}], "entry_type": "single-long", "categories": ["econ.GN", "math.DS", "math.OC", "q-fin.EC", "91B84", "I.6"], "avg_thinking_tokens": 838.0, "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"}

Specifically, how companies rely on each other \u2013 buying inputs, selling outputs. This forms a vast network, a supply chain network. My intuition is that in any network, the way things are connected, the 'topology', really matters for how stuff flows or how shocks spread. If one company hits a problem, like it can't produce something anymore, that problem doesn't just stop there. Its customers suddenly have a shortage, and its suppliers lose a buyer. This disruption can ripple through the network, potentially causing other companies to struggle or fail, leading to a cascade. This cascading failure feels like 'systemic risk' \u2013 a local issue becoming a system-wide problem because of the network structure.\n\nTraditional ways of thinking about this often focus on individual companies or maybe small parts of the chain. But what if the *overall* structure of the network is making things risky? Maybe the way companies have spontaneously linked up over time, while good for local efficiency, creates hidden vulnerabilities at a larger scale.\n\nSo, the core idea is to view the entire collection of supplier-customer relationships as a network and quantify how fragile that network is to these spreading disruptions. Is it possible that simply changing *who* buys from *whom*, or *who* sells to *whom*, could make the whole system less prone to these cascades? If a company currently relies heavily on a single, critical supplier, maybe redirecting some of that demand to other, perhaps less central, suppliers could make that company, and its downstream customers, less vulnerable if the original supplier fails.\n\nThe challenge is, can we do this 'rewiring' in a realistic way? Companies can't just connect to anyone. There are constraints \u2013 they need specific types of inputs, they need to be compatible with their suppliers and customers, there are geographical factors, and they have established production processes and capacities. And critically, any change shouldn't disrupt the fundamental economic activity \u2013 companies still need to produce the same overall amount of goods and services, using roughly the same total amounts of inputs. We can't just break supply links arbitrarily or force companies to buy inputs they don't need or from suppliers who can't provide what's required.\n\nSo, the question becomes: Within the space of possible network configurations that *respect* these firm-level production needs and overall output levels, are there alternative connection patterns that exhibit significantly lower systemic risk compared to the currently observed network? If such less-risky configurations exist within these constraints, it would suggest that the current structure isn't necessarily 'optimal' from a systemic risk perspective. It would mean the risk isn't an unavoidable consequence of *what* the economy produces or *how much*, but rather *how* the producers are connected.\n\nHow might we search for these lower-risk configurations? It seems like we'd need a way to systematically explore different connection patterns, evaluate the systemic risk for each pattern, and try to move towards patterns with less risk, all while making sure we don't violate those crucial production constraints. This sounds like an optimization problem over a network structure, where the 'fitness function' is some measure of systemic risk, and the 'moves' are constrained link changes (like swapping suppliers for companies providing the same type of input). It feels plausible that even small, targeted changes in connectivity could potentially have a disproportionately large positive impact on systemic stability, much like small changes can sometimes drastically alter the behavior of other complex systems.\n</think>\nThinking about supply chains as complex networks reveals that systemic risk isn't just about individual company failures but also how these failures propagate through interconnections. It seems plausible that strategically altering the network structure \u2013 specifically, rewiring supplier-customer links while respecting firm-level production requirements and total output \u2013 could potentially reduce the overall systemic risk of cascading disruptions. This would imply that the existing network topology might inherently carry higher risk than necessary, and alternative, more resilient configurations could exist within the boundaries of feasible production relationships.", "role": "assistant"}], "entry_type": "single-long", "categories": ["econ.GN", "physics.soc-ph", "q-fin.EC"], "avg_thinking_tokens": 724.0, "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"}

It's not just about getting internet access; it's about what that access enables.\n\nFirst, let's think about direct economic impacts. If rural residents gain access to online platforms, they could potentially sell their agricultural products or local crafts directly to consumers or markets far away, perhaps bypassing traditional intermediaries. This could lead to higher incomes from their existing activities. Digital tools might also help them manage their farms or businesses more efficiently, reducing costs and increasing productivity, which again boosts income. Furthermore, the digital economy itself can create new jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities in rural areas \u2013 think e-commerce shops, digital service provision, or even remote work for urban companies. This could provide alternative income sources beyond traditional farming.\n\nSecond, there's the angle of labor mobility and opportunity. Historically, people often move to cities for better job prospects due to information asymmetry and a lack of diverse opportunities in rural areas. With digital connectivity, rural residents could gain easier access to information about job openings, training programs, and market demands. Online education and training platforms could help them acquire new skills, making them more competitive in the job market, whether they choose to migrate or seek local non-agricultural employment. Digital platforms might also facilitate entrepreneurial activities within the village, reducing the need for everyone to leave to find work, thus promoting a more balanced labor force distribution.\n\nThird, digital development could improve the quality of life and access to essential services in rural areas. Access to online healthcare consultations (telemedicine), remote education, and digital government services could make up for some of the service disparities between urban and rural regions without requiring significant physical infrastructure investment or travel. This improved access could enhance well-being and reduce hidden costs associated with accessing services, making rural areas more attractive places to live.\n\nFinally, the spread of digital information and tools might accelerate the adoption of advanced agricultural technologies and management practices. Access to real-time data on weather, soil, market prices, or best practices from elsewhere could help farmers make more informed decisions, leading to increased productivity and a shift towards more modern, efficient agriculture. This technological progress in the rural sector is crucial for its long-term economic viability and contribution to overall prosperity.\n\nSo, in my thinking, the key pathways seem to be improving rural incomes through enhanced market access and new digital economy jobs, facilitating more effective rural labor transfer and local non-farm employment, enhancing access to public services and improving rural governance, and driving technological advancement and efficiency in agriculture. These factors combined could systematically address various dimensions of the urban-rural gap.\n</think>\nBringing digital development to rural areas can foster urban-rural common prosperity through several interconnected pathways. It can directly increase rural incomes by facilitating online sales and creating new digital economy jobs. It can promote the efficient transfer of rural labor by improving access to job information and training, while also fostering local non-agricultural employment opportunities.

My first instinct is to think that a good patent just covers a good invention. But what makes an invention \"good quality\"? Is it purely about technical superiority, like how much better a new version of something is? Or is it about how fundamentally new or disruptive it is? Technical quality seems like it could have multiple dimensions \u2013 efficiency, durability, accuracy, depending on what the invention is. And importantly, what makes an invention high quality might differ a lot depending on where or how it's used. The same core technology could be high quality for one application but less so for another, requiring different performance characteristics. So, defining invention quality itself feels complicated, maybe multi-faceted and context-dependent, and probably hard to measure with one number.\n\nThen there's the idea of the invention's value. This feels distinct from quality. Value seems tied to real-world impact, especially economic impact. An invention has value if it can be used in a product or process that people want or need, generating returns. Unlike quality, value seems like it should be measurable in monetary terms. But here too, the value might depend on the specific use case or market. The value captured by the inventor (private value) might be much less than the total benefit to society (social value), which includes things like consumer benefits and spillovers. And the full potential social value might only emerge over time as others adopt and adapt the invention. So, equating patent quality solely to the invention's economic value, particularly its private value, also feels incomplete.\n\nSo, if patent quality isn't just invention quality or invention value, what else could it be? A patent is a legal document granting rights. Maybe its quality is about the document itself? Is a high-quality patent simply a well-written one? One that clearly describes the invention and has claims that are precise and broad enough to offer strong legal protection? That makes intuitive sense from a legal drafting perspective.\n\nAnother possibility is that patent quality is about whether the patent *should have been granted* in the first place. Does the invention meet all the legal tests for patentability \u2013 is it novel, non-obvious, useful, sufficiently described? If a patent office issues a patent for something that doesn't truly meet these criteria, that patent feels like a low-quality output of the system, perhaps legally invalid. So, maybe high patent quality means the patent is legally sound and likely to withstand a challenge.\n\nThese different ways of looking at it \u2013 invention quality, invention value, drafting quality, legal validity \u2013 all seem plausible, but they don't necessarily line up perfectly. A brilliant technical invention might get a poorly drafted patent. An invention with huge societal benefit might not be the most technically complex. A patent that's legally weak might still be used to extract significant value from others just because challenging it is expensive. It seems like different stakeholders might even have their own preferred definition \u2013 engineers might think about technical quality, lawyers about drafting and validity, economists about value and impact. It highlights that the concept is multi-dimensional and requires careful consideration depending on the context.\n</think>\nThe term \"patent quality\" is understood in several ways, making it a multifaceted concept. It can refer to the intrinsic technical quality of the invention itself (its novelty, inventiveness, or superiority along various dimensions), the economic value or broader societal impact the patented invention generates, the quality of the patent document's drafting (clarity and scope of claims), or its legal validity and compliance with patentability requirements. These different perspectives highlight that a high-quality patent might be assessed based on the invention's attributes, its real-world outcomes, or the legal robustness and clarity of the granted right itself.

The core idea is that we can define their trading personality and strategy just by giving them instructions in plain language, like a system prompt telling one model to be a 'value investor' and another to be a 'market maker'.\nThe big question is, can they actually *do* that? Are these complex language models capable of understanding and consistently following these kinds of strategic directives over multiple trading rounds in a dynamic environment? It's not just about giving a single buy or sell command; it's about maintaining a strategic posture.\nFor a 'value investor', for instance, can the prompt make it consistently focus on some notion of fundamental value and trade against deviations from that? Will it try to buy when the price is low relative to its perceived value and sell when it's high, round after round? Or will it get distracted by short-term price movements or other factors?\nFor a 'market maker', the instructions might be about placing limit orders on both sides of the market to capture the bid-ask spread, and maybe adjusting that spread based on volatility. Can a prompt really encode that complex, continuous behavior? Will the model remember its role, manage its inventory (since we're limiting short selling), and consistently place appropriate limit orders?\nLanguage models are powerful pattern completers, trained on vast amounts of text. They've likely seen text describing these trading strategies. But is that enough for them to *act* as that strategy consistently within the structured environment of a market simulation? Will they grasp the operational constraints, like only selling shares they own? Will they use the specified order types (market vs. limit) as instructed?\nThere's a possibility that their responses might be inconsistent, or they might drift away from the instructed strategy over time. They might generate plausible-sounding reasoning but fail to translate it into the correct trading actions, or they might struggle with the structured output required for placing orders. Or, perhaps, the prompts are powerful enough to mold their behavior into something that genuinely resembles the intended strategy.\nIf they *can* reliably follow these prompts and maintain their strategic identity, it opens up a whole new way to simulate markets. We could create populations of diverse, prompted agents and study how different strategic compositions affect market outcomes. But the foundational step is confirming that the prompt-based strategic definition actually 'sticks' and translates into consistent, meaningful trading behavior over time within the simulation's rules.\nMy intuition is that, given their ability to follow complex instructions in other domains, LLMs *should* be able to adhere to these trading strategies to a significant degree. The challenge is translating the high-level natural language strategy into concrete, round-by-round decisions that are both consistent with the strategy and valid within the market mechanics. If successful, it validates the use of prompting as a method for creating heterogeneous agents for market simulations.\n</think>\nBased on the design of using natural language prompts to define agent roles, large language models appear capable of understanding and consistently adhering to specific trading strategies over multiple rounds in a simulated market.

We need to think about how the trend of one variable can smoothly transition to another trend. For example, an increasing trend might slow down and become constant, or even start decreasing. If we can define these fundamental transitions for individual variables, maybe we can combine them to understand how the overall system can move from one multi-variable scenario to another.

We can't say, for example, 'exports will increase by 10% next year if product innovation stays constant'. We can only say 'exports might continue increasing if product innovation is constant'.

My simple model doesn't reproduce that. Why? Maybe the assumption that all native contacts are equally important is wrong.

This gives us an \"energy map\" of the protein. By looking at this map, we can identify which specific contacts contribute the most to holding the protein together in its native state.

Yes, it seems some are. And the mutations often change a charged amino acid to something neutral or oppositely charged, which would directly disrupt that important surface interaction. This strongly suggests that messing up these specific surface contacts, not just generally destabilizing the protein, could be a primary way mutations lead to misfolding and potentially aggregation.\n</think>\nSurprisingly, the amino acid interactions that appear most crucial for protein stability and efficient two-state folding are located on the protein's surface, often involving charged residues.

Or linking one protein molecule to another? If we simulate folding starting from an unfolded state and allow *any* cysteine pair to form a disulfide bond, maybe we'll see a difference.

If these key surface interactions we identified are crucial for protecting beta-sheet edges, and mutations disrupt them, those edges might become exposed.

This area seems incredibly complex, involving many different factors \u2013 not just obvious ones like male or female management, but also things like the type of innovation (product vs. process), risk attitudes, maybe even characteristics of the business itself like size or age. The tricky part is that getting really precise, quantitative data on all these interacting elements across a decent number of SMEs is likely going to be very difficult. Information about innovation processes, risk tolerance, or the exact nuances of gender influence might be subjective, incomplete, or simply unavailable in a standardized numerical format. Traditional analytical tools, like many statistical models, rely heavily on having lots of high-quality, numerical data. A severe shortage or heterogeneity of this kind of information would make those methods hard, maybe even impossible, to apply effectively.\n\nSo, if exact numbers aren't consistently available, what's the least amount of information we *can* work with? Perhaps we don't need precise values, but just the general direction things are moving or how one factor changes in relation to another. Can we tell if something is increasing, decreasing, or staying stable? For instance, if we consider a factor like 'High-risk tolerance', we might not have a specific score, but we might have some qualitative sense whether it's generally trending upwards or downwards in a certain context. The same could apply to 'Product innovation' or even how we conceptualize the 'Gender' variable's influence.\n\nWhat if we build a model using only these qualitative 'trend' quantifiers \u2013 positive (increasing), negative (decreasing), and zero (constant)?

We wouldn't be able to say 'Innovation will increase by exactly X percent'. But we could potentially map out different possible 'scenarios' \u2013 combinations of trends that are logically consistent given the defined relationships. A scenario might look like: 'Gender influence (in a certain direction) is increasing, Product innovation is constant, and Risk tolerance is decreasing'. Furthermore, if we think about how these trends evolve over time, we could potentially identify the possible 'transitions' between these scenarios. If we're in scenario A, can we move to scenario B, and how? This would give us a kind of map, a transitional graph, showing the potential pathways the system could follow in terms of its qualitative trends.\n\nThis trend-based approach seems like a powerful way to analyze complex systems like this where precise quantitative data is scarce. It allows us to incorporate softer, less-structured knowledge, potentially model more variables than data-hungry methods, and still gain meaningful insights into the qualitative behavior and potential future states of the system. The main trade-off is the loss of numerical detail, but in situations where that detail isn't available anyway, focusing on trends might be the most practical and insightful path forward.

Meat-Free Day (MFD) is a widely adopted strategy to address this challenge by encouraging plantbased diets through the removal of animal-based meals. We assessed environmental, behavioral, and nutritional impacts of MFD by implementing 67 MFDs over 18 months (once a week on a randomly chosen day) across 12 cafeterias on a large university campus, analyzing over 400,000 food purchases. MFD reduced on-campus food-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on treated days by 52.9% and contributed to improving fiber (+26.9%) and cholesterol ( -4.5%) consumption without altering caloric intake. These nutritional benefits were, however, accompanied by a 27.6% decrease in protein intake and a 34.2% increase in sugar consumption. Moreover, the increase in plant-based meals did not carry over to subsequent days, as evidenced by a 3.5% rebound in animal-based meal consumption on days immediately following treated days, and MFD led to a 16.8% drop in on-campus meal sales on treated days. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that, if 8.7% of diners were to eat burgers off-campus on treated days, MFD's GHG savings would be fully negated. As our analysis identifies on-campus customer retention as the main challenge to MFD effectiveness, we recommend combining MFD with customer retention interventions to ensure environmental and nutritional benefits.\n\nCurrent consumption of animal-derived food is incompatible with the sustainability and nutritional targets set by the UN Sustainability and Nutrition Strategy 2022-2030 [43, 44, 57]. Achieving these goals requires wealthy countries to reduce their meat consumption by 80%, a weekly decrease of 2.4 kg/person of meat eaten [18, 46, 66]. A progressive transition to plant-based diets emerges as the most effective strategy to (i) mitigate the environmental impact of the global food systems [10, 19, 59] and (ii) provide nutritional benefits [45, 54]. Appropriately planned and supplemented vegan and vegetarian diets are nutritionally adequate for individuals in all stages of life and may provide health benefits in disease prevention [30, 65]. In contrast, the consumption of animal-based meals is a core driver of large shares of carbon emissions [28, 67] and has been associated with between 3% to 7% higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality from all causes [41, 49, 68].\n\nreduce the environmental impact of food consumption and promote healthy nutrition with one simple policy: 'Once a week, cut meat.' Ever since, MFD has become a global movement implemented in over 40 countries [56, 58, 64], hospitals [51], schools [35], and university campuses [60], affecting more than 10 000 , cafeterias and millions of people. MFD has been a controversial initiative that has also sparked political discussion [37, 40], polarized public opinion [7], and fueled debates across multiple legislative bodies [26, 52], such as the US Congress and German Parliament. Proponents praise it for potential health and environmental benefits, whereas opponents criticize it as an ineffective restriction on personal choice that is unlikely to push people towards sustainable habits.\n\nShifting behavior towards plant-based diets is difficult due to key societal barriers, including misconceptions about the nutritional value of plant-based options [16, 21], higher perceived costs of plant-based foods [14, 63], socioeconomic differences [32, 53] and cultural norms [48].\n\nIn response to these barriers, governments and institutions have funded various initiatives aimed at reducing meat consumption. The most prominent of these initiatives is 'Meat-Free Day' (MFD). Proposed more than 20 years ago [8, 38], MFD aims to\n\n\u2217 Correspondence: giuseppe.russo@epfl.ch, robert.west@epfl.ch\n\nDespite the widespread interest in the MFD initiative, existing studies have only partially addressed its effectiveness [11, 12, 33]. Most analyses have focused on changes in environmental outcomes, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or water footprint [5, 33], overlooking other critical dimensions including nutritional impacts and subsequent consumption of plantbased meals. Furthermore, the estimation of mealrelated emissions has often relied on high-level proxy measures due to the absence of detailed, ingredientlevel data [39]. Critically, these studies rarely account for unintended behavioral responses [33, 35], which are essential in assessing the effectiveness of any policiy [34, 50]. Even when compensatory behaviors are considered, evaluations typically occur under unrealistic conditions-such as infrequent scheduling [39] or scenarios lacking alternative animal-based meal op-\n\ntions [35]-severely limiting the assessment of MFD effectiveness.\n\nIn this work, we overcome these limitations by conducting a large-scale evaluation of the MFD initiative. Our analysis leverages detailed transactional data alongside precise ingredient-level emissions and nutritional information to rigorously assess the primary objectives of the MFD initiative: (i) institutional reductions in GHG emissions, (ii) behavioral shifts toward reduced meat consumption, and (iii) enhancements in nutritional quality aligned with established dietary guidelines.\n\nPresent work. For each of these objectives, we formulate a corresponding research question:\n\nRQ1: Does restricting the availability of animalbased meals via MFD lead to a measurable reduction in the GHG emissions associated with food purchases?\n\nRQ2: Does the restriction of choice via MFD trigger behavioral responses that counteract its intended effects?\n\nRQ3: What are the nutritional implications of MFD, and does the removal of meat-based meals lead to compensatory consumption of alternatives?\n\nTo answer these research questions, we implemented the Meat-Free Day initiative 67 times across all 12 cafeterias on the EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne) campus in Lausanne, Switzerland. The intervention was conducted once a week over 18 months, with a single day each week randomly selected to serve as an MFD. This random selection was made by the administration without prior notice to the campus community. In total, to study the impact of these 67 MFDs, we analyzed 402 536 , food purchases.\n\nIn RQ1 , we assess the impact of MFD on GHG emissions associated with on-campus food consumption. By analyzing purchasing patterns across university cafeterias, we quantify how the removal of animalbased meals directly influences the GHG emissions of the campus food system.\n\nIn RQ2 , we test the hypothesis that perceived restriction of choice leads to behavioral responses that could counteract MFD's intended effects [6, 62]. Specifically, we examine two mechanisms: (i) opt-out behavior , where customers circumvent MFD by eating off-campus, presumably consuming animal-based meals, and (ii) rebound effects , where individuals increase their consumption of animal-based meals on subsequent days to compensate.\n\nIn RQ3 , we assess the nutritional consequences of MFDbyanalyzing shifts in calories and macronutrient intake. While plant-based diets provide health benefits [9, 27], the removal of animal-based meals may introduce unintended dietary imbalances. Additionally, previous research indicates that customers often perceive vegetarian meals as less nutritious [3, 29, 31], which may prompt them to compensate by purchasing energy-dense snacks or drinks from vending machines and cafeterias [23].\n\nTo evaluate the effects of MFD, we adopt two complementary setups. The first setup, which we term on-MFD Analysis , examines the immediate impact of MFD on the day of intervention, assessing its effects on three outcomes: (i) GHG emissions (RQ1), (ii) opt-out behavior (RQ2), and (iii) caloric and macronutrient intake (RQ3). To measure these changes, we compared each MFD with a corresponding non-MFD on the same weekday of the preceding week (see Fig. 1(a)).\n\nThe second setup, which we term beyond-MFD Analysis , extends the investigation to the days following MFD, evaluating whether the intervention produces beneficial changes in customers' eating habits or triggers unintended compensatory behaviors that could reduce the intended benefits. To assess this, we analyze variations in the three outcomes described for the on-MFD Analysis on two non-MFDs from consecutive weeks: one occurring the day after an MFD and another occurring at least two days after the MFD of its respective week (see Fig. 1(b)).\n\nFindings. Our findings demonstrate that MFDtreated days achieve a remarkable 52.9% reduction in food-system GHG emissions compared to untreated days. ( RQ1, on-MFD Analysis ). Although this reduction underscores the environmental benefits of MFD, we also identify unintended consequences: meal sales drop by 16.8%, which translates to 520 fewer meals sold compared to the daily baseline of 3,092 meals on non-MFDs ( RQ2, on-MFD Analysis ). This decline suggests a behavioral shift, likely driven by the perceived restriction of choice, with customers opting out of MFD to eat off-campus.\n\nOpt-out customers are likely to consume animalbased meals off-campus. They may choose from either a nearby fast-food restaurant serving burgers or other off-campus options offering animal-based meals with lower emissions than burgers. Due to the lack of data on off-campus dining sales, we used Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the impact of off-campus dining on MFD's overall GHG emission savings. This analysis revealed that, even assuming that all opt-out customers choose the lower-emission options, 58.6% of MFD's GHG emission savings could be offset by these choices. Our simulation indicates that the GHG emission savings achieved by MFD would be fully offset by off campus diners if 50.1% of them ate burgers. That corresponds to 8.7% of the campus community that dine in cafeterias on a typical day.\n\nFurthermore, we found no evidence that exposure to vegetarian meals during MFD fosters plant-based\n\n## Impact of Meat-Free Day (MFD)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(b) Setup 2:\n\nBeyond\n\n-MFD Analysis\n\nFIG. 1. Analysis setups to estimate the effect of Meat-Free Day (MFD). (a) on-MFD Analysis: This setup examines the direct impact of MFD on three key outcomes: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions ( RQ1 ), sales patterns ( RQ2 ), and nutrient intake ( RQ3 ). Each MFD (randomly assigned to a weekday in week t +1 ) is matched with a corresponding non-MFD from the preceding week t , occurring on the same weekday. This comparison quantifies the immediate effect \u2206 on these outcomes. (b) beyond-MFD Analysis: This setup investigates potential rebound effects by analyzing consumer behavior on the day following an MFD. A non-MFD in week t +1 that occurs immediately after week t +1 's MFD is matched with a non-MFD from week t that occurs on the same weekday, but at least two days after week t 's MFD. This comparison assesses whether MFD triggers compensatory behaviors that could counteract its intended effects.\n\neating habits beyond the intervention day. We observe a statistically significant increase of 4.3% in GHG emissions on the day following an MFD, with a 3.5% rise in animal-based meal sales compared to nonMFDs occurring at least two days after an MFD ( RQ1 and RQ2, beyond-MFD Analysis )).\n\nin protein highlights the need to carefully design vegetarian meal options to minimize potential adverse effects.\n\nRegarding the impact of MFD on nutritional value, we find no measurable change in total caloric intake, suggesting that implementing MFD does not inherently reduce overall calories.\n\nHowever, the impact on macronutrient intake is mixed. An increase in fiber (+27.2%) and the reduction in cholesterol ( -4 5% . ) suggest potential health benefits. At the same time, an increase in sugar intake (+39.9%) and a decrease in protein intake ( -27 1% . ) may warrant attention if sustained over time. While there is no increase in the consumption of unhealthy items (e.g., desserts, vending machine items) overall, we found a 15.9% increase in dessert purchases, maybe to offset a perceived decrease in calories [13]-a common bias observed in customers consuming plantbased meals. However, we find no measurable change in total caloric, macronutrient, and unhealthy-item intake on days immediately following MFD-treated days.\n\nImplications. Our work shows that the Meat-Free Day initiative is not a silver bullet. From a nutritional perspective, while MFD can introduce positive dietary shifts such as increased fiber consumption, the concurrent increase in sugar intake and reduction\n\nMoreover, although MFD yields substantial reductions in GHG emissions associated with campus food consumption on treated days themselves, our findings identify customer retention as a critical barrier to the overall success of the intervention. The identification of retention as a pivotal factor highlights two potential strategies for enhancing the environmental impact of MFD. The first involves integrating MFD with complementary interventions designed to improve customer participation in MFD on campus. The second approach suggests moving beyond rigid frameworks like MFD by intervening more deeply in the environmental setup of cafeterias. This could involve strategies such as reducing the prominence of high-emission ingredients while promoting a balanced selection of animal- and plant-based meal options.\n\n## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\n\nMeat-Free Day schedule. We implemented Meat-Free Day (MFD) in all 12 cafeterias of the EPFL campus for a period of 18 months (March 2022 to August 2023). On MFD, all meals served in the campus cafeterias-each offering between two and seven menu options-were exclusively plant-based.\n\nUnlike traditional setups where MFD is scheduled\n\non a specific day of the week (e.g., Meatless Monday [42]), our approach consisted in assigning MFD to a random weekday for each week of the study, such that MFD was not associated with a specific weekday. The campus administration randomly selected one weekday per week throughout the study period, exluding weekends and public holidays. During the study period, a total of 77 MFDs were scheduled.\n\nImportantly, the campus community-including students, employees, and visitors-was not notified in advance of MFDs. Participants could identify MFDs only via using the campus app that shows menus of the cafeterias (slightly before service time) or upon entering cafeterias, where digital screens displayed meal options that were entirely vegetarian. For our analysis, we focus on meals purchased during lunch, as the vast majority of the campus community consumes their primary meal at that time.\n\nEstimation. To assess the impact of MFD, we employed two complementary setups: On -MFD Analysis and Beyond -MFD Analysis.\n\nIn the on-MFD Analysis, we used a matched-pairs design, comparing each MFD to a corresponding non-MFD from the preceding week. Both days were matched to fall on the same weekday (e.g., a meatfree Wednesday was compared to the previous week's non-meat-free Wednesday; see Fig. 1(a)). This design accounted for day-specific patterns in cafeteria attendance. To further improve the comparability within matched pairs, we excluded week pairs where (i) MFD fell on the same weekday in both weeks, (ii) one of the two weeks was the first or last week of a semester, or (iii) the two weeks fell in different periods of the academic calendar (e.g., lecture weeks, exam periods, or breaks), to avoid comparing weeks with different levels of on-campus presence. This process yielded 67 valid MFD/non-MFD pairs, corresponding to 134 analyzed days and 402,536 food purchase transactions.\n\nUsing this matched sample, we estimated the variation ( \u2206 ) in three key outcomes between MFDs and their matched non-MFDs. First, greenhouse gas emissions ( \u2206 GHG ), measured as the equivalent kilograms of CO 2 (kgCO e) associated with the entirety of meals 2 sold daily. The CO 2 equivalent (kgCO e) is a stan2 dardized measure used to compare emissions from various greenhouse gases (e.g., methane) based on their global warming potential relative to the one of carbon dioxide. Second, the number of meals sold daily ( \u2206 sales ), obtained from EPFL's transaction log system, which records real-time sales across all campus cafeterias; and (iii) the variation in caloric ( \u2206 cal ) and macronutrient ( \u2206 nutr ) intake per customer.\n\nIn the beyond-MFD Analysis, we investigated whether MFD leads to sustained behavioral changes or unintended compensatory effects on the same three outcomes as above. We again employed a matchedpairs design, now comparing two non-MFDs from consecutive weeks (Fig. 1b): one non-MFD immediately following the MFD (week t + 1 ), the other non-MFD occurring at least two days after the MFD (week t ). We obtained 56 valid MFD/non-MFD pairs for this setup.\n\nWe estimated the effect of MFD on the above outcomes using a generalized linear model (GLM) (see Materials and Methods for model specification).\n\n## RESULTS OF ON-MFD ANALYSIS\n\nMFD reduces immediate greenhouse gas emissions (RQ1). In order to analyze the impact of MFD on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the 12 campus cafeterias, we compared the total daily GHG emissions from meals sold on MFDs to those sold on matched non-MFDs (see Fig. 1(a)) using the regression model described in Equation 1. The model estimated a decrease in overall GHG emissions of \u2206 GHG = -5 053 kgCO e per day ( 2 p &lt; 0 001 . , t = -11 94 . , 95% CI [ -5889 , -4216] , see Table I in SI ), from an average of 9534 kgCO e per day 2 ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 31 87 . , 95% CI [8 942 , 10100] ) on non-MFDs to an average 4 481 , per day ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 14 98 . , 95% CI [3 889 , 5072] ) on MFDs. This decrease corresponds to a relative decrease in terms of GHG emissions of 52.9%. W\n\nFig. 2(a) illustrates the average GHG emissions for both MFDs and non-MFDs by month of the year. The reduction in emissions remained consistent and statistically significant throughout all months of the study, suggesting that the effect of the intervention is robust to seasonal variations.\n\nMFD increases off-campus dining (RQ2). It is conceivable that MFD can create a sense of restriction, causing some diners to purchase animal-based meals off-campus, thus limiting the benefits of MFD. Since off-campus transaction data is not available to us, we instead approximate the impact of MFD on offcampus dining by analyzing whether MFD led to a measurable decrease in on-campus meal sales.\n\nEstimating the average daily percentage change in food sales on MFDs compared to matched nonMFDs revealed a significant daily decrease in sales of \u2206 sales = 16 8% . on MFDs ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = -11 92 . , 95% CI [ -19 9% . , -14 2%] . , see Table III in SI ) ). Daily sales declined from 3 092 , ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 32 05 . , 95% CI [2 901 , 3283 ]) on non-MFDs to 2 579 , on MFDs ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = -12 29 . , 95% CI [2 489 , 2656] ). This corresponds to an average daily reduction of 520 customers (under the assumption that each customer\n\nFIG. 2. Impact of Meat-Free Days (MFD) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and on-campus meal sales. (a) GHG emissions: Average monthly GHG emissions on MFDs (blue) compared to matched non-MFDs (orange). We observe a consistent and significant reduction in GHG emissions throughout the study period, with an overall decrease of 5,053 kgCO 2 e/day ( p &lt; 0 001 . ), corresponding to a relative reduction of 52.9%. (b) Sales: Average monthly on-campus meal sales on MFDs (blue) compared to non-MFDs (orange). Meal sales significantly decreased by an average of 16.8% ( p &lt; 0 001 . ) on MFDs, suggesting increased off-campus dining and potential offsetting of on-campus emission savings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconsumed one meal).\n\nFig. 2(b) illustrates the daily average on-campus sales for both MFDs and non-MFDs by month of the year. The difference between meal purchases on MFDs vs. non-MFDs is statistically significant throughout the study period.\n\nThese results emphasize that, although MFD achieves significant immediate on-campus GHG reductions on the treated days themselves, overall effects may be reduced due to lacking customer retention. The following analysis addresses this concern.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOff-campus dining may negate environmental benefits (RQ1, RQ2). Off-campus diners can choose between two options: (i) a fast-food restaurant offering a discounted student menu and (ii) a mix of alternatives, including pre-packaged grocery store meals, a taco shop (partially closed during the study), and a higher-end sit-down restaurant (We provide a map of the campus showing the distance from campus to these options, see SI Section B ).\n\nUsing GHG emissions data from comparable oncampus meals, we estimate that a meal from the fast-food student menu generates an average of 13 5 . kgCO e (SD = 3.5) per customer, while other off2 campus options-assuming a typical meal structure of animal protein, dairy, carbohydrates, and a side-emit an average of 5 7 . kgCO e (SD = 2.5) 2 per meal.\n\nSince the exact proportion of opt-out customers choosing fast food vs. other alternatives, as well as the GHG emissions from all off-campus meals, are unknown, we use Monte Carlo simulation to model the impact of off-campus dining under the variability of these parameters (see Materials and Methods for details).\n\nUnder the most optimistic scenario-where no opt-\n\nFIG. 3. Impact of off-campus dining on GHG emission savings. Results from Monte Carlo simulations accounting for variability in the proportion of fast-food customers (xaxis). The x-axis represents the expected proportion of fastfood customers, computed as the mean \u03b1/ \u03b1 ( + \u03b2 ) of a Beta distribution where \u03b1 and \u03b2 represent the assumed number of fast-food and non-fast-food customers, respectively. The y-axis shows the percentage offset in GHG due to off-campus dining. In the best-case scenario, where no off-campus customers visit fast-food restaurants, the offset effect reaches 58.7%. The average offset is not statistically different from the break-even point (red line) at 40% (95% CI [82.2%, 106.1%]). On average, the break-even point is reached at 50.2% fast-food proportion, beyond which the offset exceeds the emissions savings from MFD.\n\nout customers choose fast food-off-campus dining offsets 58.6% (95% CI [53.1%, 64.4%]) of the GHG reductions achieved by MFD (see Fig. 3). This scenario is, however, unlikely. The campus community is composed of roughly 70% students, a group more likely to be drawn to the discounted student menu at the fast-food restaurant. In Fig. 3 we show that as the proportion of opting-out customers eating at the fast-food increases, the offset effect intensifies.\n\nAt 40% fast-food participation, off-campus emissions counteract 93.6% (95% CI [82 2% 106 1%] . , . ) of MFD savings, reaching levels statistically indistinguishable from full offset (i.e., 100%).\n\nWe estimate that off-campus emissions fully offset MFD-induced savings when 50.2% of opt-out customers choose fast food. This 'break-even' point corresponds to 270 customers, equivalent to 8.7% of the campus population that dines in cafeterias on a regular day. Beyond this threshold, off-campus dining not only negates the positive impact of MFD, but even leads to a net increase in emissions, surpassing levels observed on non-MFD days.\n\nMFD maintains caloric intake but affects macronutrient mix (RQ3). The scope of MFD extends beyond sustainability, offering the prospect to also promote healthier dietary habits by improving the consumption of key nutrients. We therefore estimated the difference in the average caloric ( \u2206 cal ) and macronutrient consumption ( \u2206 nutr ) per customer on MFDs vs. non-MFDs.\n\nWe first assessed whether the daily caloric intake during non-MFDs complied with recommended dietary guidelines from governmental institutions [15, 17]. The analysis revealed an average caloric intake of 682.9 kcal per customer ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 41 07 . , 95% CI [650 0 . , 715 8] . , see Table V in SI ), aligning with the suggested range of 625-700 kcal per meal (see Fig. 4, top row).\n\nWe then examined whether caloric intake differed between MFDs and non-MFDs. The results showed no statistically significant difference, with an estimated difference of \u2206 cal = -4 1 . kcal ( p = 0 864 . , t = -0 171 . , 95% CI [ -50 53 42 50] . , . , see Table V in SI ). These findings indicate that MFDs do not alter the caloric intake per customer.\n\nMacronutrient consumption on non-MFDs aligns with recommended dietary guidelines, with the sole exception of sodium. During non-MFDs, the average sodium intake is 3.32 grams per meal ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 9 86 . , 95% CI [2 6 . , 3 9] . , see Table S5 in SI ), exceeding the recommended limit of 1.6 grams per meal. MFD reduction of sodium remain not statistically significant different from the non-MFD sodium consumption ( \u2206 sod = -0 23 . grams ( p = 0 626 . , t = -0 48 . , 95% CI [ -1 18 0 71] . , . ) and therefore remains above guideline levels (see Fig. 4, second row).\n\nMFDs improved the nutritional profile of meals consumed by increasing fiber intake and reducing cholesterol intake. Specifically, fiber consumption increased by \u2206 fiber = 2 40 . grams per meal ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 4 44 . , 95% CI [1 33 . , 3 47] . , see Table V in SI ), representing a 26.9% increase from the average fiber intake of 8.91 grams on non-MFDs. Similarly, cholesterol consumption decreased by \u2206 chol = -0 23 . grams per meal ( p &lt; 0 005 . , t = -0 313 . , 95% CI [ -0 36 . , -0 09] . , , see Table V in SI ), corresponding to a 4.50% reduction. Furthermore, monounsaturated fat intake increased by \u2206 M-fat = 0 97 . grams per meal ( p = 0 009 . , t = 2 64 . , 95% CI [0 26 . , 1 70] . ) corresponding to a relative increase of 15.2%. These variations are desirable, as they are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease [1, 2] and improvements for digestive health [22, 55].\n\nOn the flip side, MFDs resulted in a significant reduction in protein intake ( \u2206 protein = -5 94 . grams, p &lt; 0 001 . , t = -8 76 . , 95% CI [ -7 29 . , -4 60] . , see Table V in SI ), and in a increase in carbohydrates consumption \u2206 carbs = 17 38 . grams, p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 4 98 . , 95% CI [10 47 . , 24 30] . ). These variations corresponded to a 27.6% decrease for proteins and a 20.6% increase for carbs pushing the consumption of these nutrients beyond the quantities reccomended by guidelines. Also, sugar intake increased by \u2206 sugar = 1 42 . grams ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 5 99 . , 95% CI [0 95 . , 1 88] . ), representing a 34.2% increase, but its consumption stays within recommended guidelines. These changes indicate possible nutritional shortfall, given the critical role of protein in maintaining muscle mass [47], the risk of fluctuations in blood sugar [36], and potential weight gain [61].\n\nMFD does not affect unhealthy-item consumption (RQ3). The perception that vegetarian meals lack sufficient nutrition or energy is well-documented [3, 29, 31]. This perception may lead individuals to compensate by purchasing additional, potentially unhealthy items on MFDs. To investigate this, we analyzed the percentage daily changes in sales across four categories: (i) vending machine items, (ii) energy and sugary drinks, (iii) pastries and snacks, and (iv) desserts.\n\nOur analysis revealed no statistically significant changes in sales for vending machine items, energy and sugary drinks, or pastries and snacks (see Fig. 5). Dessert sales, however, increased on MFDs, with an estimated percentage increase per customer of \u2206 sales = 15 9% . ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 3 35 . , 95% CI [10 9 . , 27 2] . ). This corresponds to an additional 27 desserts sold compared to a baseline of 167 desserts on non-MFDs ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 22 16 . , 95% CI [151 5 . , 180 9] . ).\n\nSince desserts are purchased at the same time as meals, customers may already be aware that they will be eating a vegeterian meal. This awareness could trigger pre-existing beliefs that vegetarian meals are less nutritionally adequate, prompting them to complement their meal with a dessert. In contrast, the other three food categories are usually bought after dining, when the main meal choice has already been made, and are therefore less influenced by the perceived nutritional content of the meal. This may\n\nexplain why desserts are affected by the intervention, while other categories are not.\n\n## RESULTS OF BEYOND-MFD ANALYSIS\n\nMFD triggers rebound in GHG emissions (RQ1). The absence of animal-based options on MFDs may trigger, among some diners, a rebound effect that increases meat consumption on subsequent days. To assess this effect, we used our second Setup Beyond MFD defined in Experimental Design Section (see Fig. 1).\n\nOur analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in GHG emissions of 414.2 kgCO e ( 2 p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 8 68 . , 95% CI [366 5 . , 461 9] . ) on the non-MFD day immediately following an MFD compared to a non-MFD day at least two days after the MFD. Accounting for this rebound effect, the net daily GHG savings attributed to MFD are reduced to \u2206 GHG = -4634 kgCO e, 2 down from the initial 5,053 kgCO e estimated in the on-MFD Analysis 2 ( on-MFD Analysis , RQ1). We report all results in Section A Table I and II of the SI\n\nMFD triggers rebound in animal-based meal sales (RQ2). Using the beyond-MFD Analysis setup, we examined changes in animal-based meal consumption, defining these meals as those containing white or red meat, fish, seafood, or dairy as primary protein sources. Our analysis identified a modest but significant increase of \u2206 sales = 3 5% . ( p = 0 008 . , t = 2 70 . , 95% CI [0 7% 5 8%] . , . ). Consumption rose from 56.8% on non-MFDs at least two days after an MFD( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 63 26 . , 95% CI [55 2% 58 8%] . , . ) to 60.5% ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = 66 55 . , 95% CI [58 7% 62 3%] . , . ) on non-MFDs immediately following an MFD.\n\nMFD does not trigger nutritional rebound (RQ3). To assess whether MFDs have a spillover effect on customers' nutritional intake on subsequent non-MFDs, we analyzed variations in caloric and macronutrient consumption ( \u2206 cal , \u2206 nutr ) following MFDs. Our analysis did not identify any statistically significant changes in overall caloric intake or macronutrient composition between non-MFDs occurring one day after an MFD and those occurring more than one day after an MFD. The estimated variation in caloric intake was \u2206 cal = 2 4 . kcal ( p = 0 567 . , 95% CI [ -78 2 82 3] . , . ), with similar null results observed across all macronutrient categories. Likewise, we found no statistically significant changes in the consumption of vending machine items, sugary drinks, desserts, or pastries.\n\nFIG. 4. Impact of Meat-Free Day (MFD) on caloric and macronutrient intake. Average intake of calories and macronutrients on MFDs and non-MFDs (x-axis) compared to recommended guidelines (gray boxes). Calories are measured in kcal and scaled by a factor of 100, whereas carbohydrates are scaled by a factor of 10 to align with the visualization of error bars for other macronutrients. This figure shows the diverse impact of MFD on nutrition: while it preserves caloric intake and it improves fiber and cholesterol consumption, there are risk due to lower protein and higher carbohydrate intake.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFIG. 5. Changes in sales of unhealthy food items on Meat-Free Days (MFDs). Percentage daily changes in sales for vending machine items, energy and sugary drinks, pastries and snacks, and desserts on MFDs relative to nonMFDs. No significant differences were observed for vending machine items, energy and sugary drinks, or pastries and snacks. However, dessert sales increased by 15.9% ( p &lt; 0 001 . ), corresponding to an additional 27 desserts sold compared to a baseline of 167 desserts on non-MFDs. This increase suggests a potential compensatory behavior driven by the perception that vegetarian meals are less nutritionally adequate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ROBUSTNESS CHECKS\n\nTo ensure the validity of our findings, we conducted two robustness checks assessing potential biases in our experimental design\n\nPlacebo test. We first conducted a placebo test by comparing two non-MFD days occurring on the same weekday in consecutive weeks (similarly to Fig. 1(b) but without considering the distance from the MFD). Using the same constraints as the main analysis (see Estimation in the Experimental Design Section, we collected 260 matched non-MFD pairs. The\n\nresults confirm the absence of systematic differences, with no significant variation in GHG emissions (92.32 KgCO e, 2 t = 0 12 . , p = 0 901 . ) or meal sales ( -57 purchases, t = -0 27 . , p = 0 788 . ). Macronutrient intake also showed no statistically significant differences across all tested categories (see Supplementary Information) This test confirms that there are no differences between same weekdays of consecutive weeks in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, sales, and nutritional intake. Therefore, the observed difference of our study are determined by MFD..\n\nComparison with subsequent week. In our primary analysis, we matched each MFD with a nonMFD from the previous week. To test the robustness of our results, we repeated the analysis using a non-MFD from the following week instead. Our results remain identical compared to those shown in our main analysis, and significantly so. More specifically, for RQ1 and RQ2 in the on-MFD Analysis, we found a reduction of GHG emissions of 5 338 kgCO e 2 ( p &lt; 0 001 . , t = -14 98 . , 95% CI [ -6167 , -4508] ). Also, we observed a reduction of 531 transactions ( p = 0 04 . , t = -2 56 . , 95% CI [ -937 , -125] ). For RQ1 and RQ2 in the beyond-MFD analysis, we find an increase in GHG emissions of 431 kgCO e ( 2 p = 0 012 . , t = 11 62 . , 95% CI [358 504] , ) and an increase in animal-based meals of 3.2% ( p = 0 006 . , t = 2 50 . , 95% CI [0 1% 5%] . , ). Results on nutritional values remain statistically significant equivalent to those of our main analysis, we report this in the Supplementary materials given the high number of macronutrients that we analyzed in our analysis.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nOur study demonstrates the potential of Meat-Free Day (MFD) in advancing more sustainable and healthier food systems. By reducing immediate on-campus greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by over 50%, MFD emerges as an easy-to-implement strategy to mitigate the environmental impact of campus dining. Beyond curbing GHG emissions, MFD also improves dietary quality on key metrics-boosting fiber intake and lowering cholesterol-all without affecting caloric intake.\n\nOur findings, nonetheless, highlight the vulnerability of such interventions to behavioral spillover. If 8.7% of regular cafeteria customers choose to eat high-emission meals off-campus-rather than participating in MFD-it could entirely nullify the GHG reductions achieved through MFD. We also observed a 3.52% increase in animal-based meal consumption 6on non-MFD days following an MFD, compared to other non-MFD days. This pattern suggests that strict interventions like MFD, which force customers to choose plant-based meals, may inadvertently push consumers toward less sustainable choices when restrictions are lifted. This dynamic raises concerns about the effectiveness of MFD in achieving sustained reductions in institutional emissions and in catalyzing lasting dietary shifts.\n\nPolicy implications. Our analysis identifies customer retention as the central challenge limiting the efficacy of MFD and hints at two alternative pathways for addressing this issue.\n\nThe second pathway proposes flexible interventions that reduce the rigidity of MFD and promote gradual dietary changes. Strictly removing all animal-based meals provokes resistance and unintended behaviors, such as the increase in off-campus dining. Instead, targeted strategies-like reducing the availability of high-emission foods such as red meat and substituting them with more sustainable options (white meat, fish)-can achieve GHG reductions without alienating diners. These less restrictive measures align with behavioral research, which highlights the effectiveness of subtle modifications to environments in steering consumer choices [20, 25].\n\nThe first pathway emphasizes synergistic approaches to incentivize customer retention on campus during MFD. Loyalty programs, such as fidelity cards, present a promising avenue for boosting customer retention. These cards grant discounts on subsequent meals after participating on MFDs, they require minimal logistical changes, and have proven effective in fostering customer retention in similar contexts [4, 24].\n\nFuture work and limitations. Future research should focus on testing MFD in combination with other interventions to identify the most effective strategies for improving customer retention and unlocking the full environmental benefits of these initiatives. Synergistic strategies, such as loyalty programs or targeted reductions in high-emission foods, should be examined to understand how they interact with MFD in fostering on-campus engagement and reducing behavioral spillover effects.\n\nAdditionally, exploring the implementation of MFD in diverse settings, such as hospitals, workplaces, or community dining spaces, could provide valuable in-\n\nFurther studies should also address a critical limitation of our analysis: the inability to monitor food behaviors off-campus. Whereas we have robust data about on-campus dining, we lack information on whether diners compensate by consuming highemission meals elsewhere. This limitation could be addressed through complementary methods such as interviews, surveys, or data donation studies, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of rebound effects and allow for more accurate evaluations of MFD efficacy.\n\nsights into how different environments influence their effectiveness. These contexts may exhibit unique dining behaviors and logistical challenges, which could inform the design of tailored interventions to maximize retention and impact.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nData. We leverage an anonymized dataset of food purchases made on the EPFL university campus. The data span from February 1, 2022, to September 1, 2023, and contain approximately 3.3 million transactions. Each transaction is linked to an anonymized ID and includes metadata such as the timestamp, location, cash register, purchased items, and price. The dataset covers all food outlets permanently located on campus, including restaurants, cafes, and vending machines. The locations are illustrated in the Supplementary Material, Section S1.7. All transactions are annotate with a textual description representing the category associated with the transaction (e.g., dessert, snack, student menu).\n\nAdditionally, each transaction is annotated with demographic attributes, including gender, age, and campus status (student, staff, visitor). Campus meal prices range from CHF 5.5 to CHF 16.5, with discounts available for students and staff. Our analysis of Meat Free Days (MFDs) focuses on 363,630 meal purchases. For unhealthy items such as snacks and drinks consumed outside main meals, we extend the timeframe and examine 402,536 transactions. A detailed breakdown is provided in the Supplementary Information (SI).\n\nFor transactions occurring during lunch hours (11:00-14:00), we integrate additional information, including a detailed textual description of the meal, a breakdown of its ingredients, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per ingredient, and portion sizes (i.e., quantity of each ingredient). The dataset comprises over 7,700 unique ingredients. Examples of meal options available on Meat Free Days (MFDs) and non-MFDs are provided in the Supplementary Material.\n\n## Statistical model.\n\nTo analyze the effect of Meat-Free Days (MFD) on various outcomes, we formalize our model as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere A i \u2208 { 0 1 , } indicates whether day i is a MeatFree Day, and P i is a categorical variable representing the period of the academic calendar to which the day belongs (lecture, break, or exam). The inclusion of P i accounts for potential seasonal effects or behavioral shifts in food consumption across different academic periods. The error term \u03f5 i captures unobserved factors influencing the outcome.\n\nThe outcome variable y i varies across RQs. y i represents (i) the total GHG emissions associated with all meals (RQ1) sold on a given day, (ii) the total number of meals sold (RQ2), and the pverall daily caloric and macronutrients intake (RQ3).\n\nMonte Carlo simulation of off-campus GHG emissions. To estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with off-campus dining on meatfree days (MFDs), we accounted for two key uncertainties: the proportion of opting-out diners who choose high-emission fast-food restaurants versus lower-emission alternatives, and the emissions associated with these meals, given the absence of direct sales transaction data.\n\nTo address this, we implemented a Monte Carlo simulation to explore a range of plausible scenarios and assess whether the emissions savings from MFDs are sustained or offset under different behavioral assumptions. The simulation is parameterized by three components: the number of diners opting out of on-campus meals, the proportion selecting fastfood restaurants, and the emissions per meal in each dining category.\n\nThe number of opting-out diners is modeled as a Poisson-distributed variable with \u03bb = 520 , based on prior estimates. The fraction of diners choosing fast food is drawn from a Beta distribution, F x \u03b1,\u03b2 ( ; ) , where \u03b1 and \u03b2 determine the shape of the distribution and control the likelihood of different fast-food uptake proportions. Larger values of \u03b1 relative to \u03b2 increase the probability of diners selecting fast food, while larger values of \u03b2 bias the distribution toward alternative dining choices.\n\nTo account for variability in emissions, meal-related GHG emissions are modeled as normally distributed, where fast-food meals follow N (14 2 . , 3 5 . 2 ) kgCO e 2 per meal, and other alternatives follow N (5 7 . , 2 5 . 2 ) kgCO e per meal. 2\n\nFor each simulation iteration, the number of optingout diners is drawn from a Poisson distribution. Each diner is assigned to fast food or an alternative dining option using the Beta-distributed fraction. Emissions are then sampled from the respective normal distributions and summed to estimate total off-campus emissions. Net emissions are computed by subtracting the estimated MFD savings of 5,053.02 kgCO e. 2 This process is repeated 10,000 times for each Beta parameter configuration to generate a distribution of net emissions outcomes. From each set of 10,000 simulations, we compute the mean net emissions and the associated 95% confidence intervals (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles). We also track whether net emissions\n\nexceed zero, identifying the proportion of fast-food diners at which MFD savings are fully offset.\n\n- [1] James W Anderson, Pat Baird, Richard H Davis Jr, Stefanie Ferreri, Mary Knudtson, Ashraf Koraym, Valerie Waters, and Christine L Williams.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies (NDA) provides guidance on the translation of nutrient based dietary advice into guidance, intended for the European population as a whole, on the contribution of different foods or food groups to an overall diet that would help to maintain good health through optimal nutrition (food-based dietary guidelines). The main focus of this Opinion is put on the scientific process of developing food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) for the diverse European populations, following a stepwise approach which consist of: 1) Identification of diet-health relationships, 2) Identification of country specific diet-related health problems, 3) Identification of nutrients of public health importance, 4) Identification of foods relevant for FBDG, 5) Identification of food consumption patterns, 6) Testing and optimising FBDG.\n\nBased on this approach the FBDG determines the quantities of daily calories and as a consequences of macro- and micro-nutrients for an average individual in order to sustain a healthy and balanced life style. We report here only macro nutrients as these were the only once to have access to for the analysis in RQ3.\n\n- \u00b7 Energy (Calories): 2000 - 2500 kcal/day\n- \u00b7 Macronutrients:\n- \u00b7 Proteins: 0.83 g/kg of body weight/day (approximately 58 g/day for a 70 kg adult)\n- \u00b7 Total Fat: 20%-35% of total energy intake\n- \u00b7 Saturated Fat: Less than 10% of total energy intake\n- \u00b7 Monounsaturated Fat: 10%-20% of total energy intake\n- \u00b7 Polyunsaturated Fat: 6%-11% of total energy intake\n- \u00b7 Carbohydrates: 45%-60% of total energy intake\n- \u00b7 Sugars: Less than 10% of total energy intake\n- \u00b7 Dietary Fiber: At least 25 g/day\n\n## Nutrients Analysis\n\nTable XVI reports the regression outcomes for the absolute changes in grams for the macronutrients analyzed. To provide context, we also calculate the overall percentage change by comparing these shifts to baseline values observed on non-Meat-Free Days (non-MFDs), which are included in the table for reference. This comparison allows us to quantify the relative impact of MFDs on nutrient intake, highlighting both increases and decreases across key dietary components.\n\n## Consumption of Unhealthy Items\n\nTable VI reports the regression results capturing the absolute change in the consumption of unhealthy items, categorized into four distinct groups: desserts and sweets, sugary drinks, coffee and hot drinks, and vending machine items. This classification allows us to clearly quantify the impact of Meat-Free Days (MFDs) on the selection of these potentially harmful products, providing insights into behavioral shifts in consumer choices.\n\nTABLE V.

We match the non-MFD occurred one day after MFD with a non-MFD that occurred at least two days after the MFD of the following week. analysi reduction of the carbon footprint.

On non-MFDs, 51.6% of the meals served on campus were vegetarian, while, as expected, 100% of meals were vegetarian on MFDs. Table XIX presents the average number of vegetarian meals served on both MFDs and non-MFDs.\n\nDespite this variability, the most frequently used ingredients remained consistent across both MFDs and non-MFDs. Fig. 6 shows the top 50 ingredients used on both types of days, ranked by their relative frequency of use.\n\nTo explore whether this increase in vegetarian meal production on MFDs affected ingredient usage, we analyzed the detailed ingredient data for each meal. We found an 85% overlap in vegetarian ingredients between MFDs and non-MFDs, with the remaining 15% difference stemming from a greater variety of ingredients used on MFDs. For instance, while only four types of rice were used on non-MFDs, eight varieties appeared on MFDs, a pattern similarly observed with legumes, mozzarella, and tomatoes.\n\nTABLE XIX. Comparison of vegetarian meal percentages served on non-MFDs (second column) and MFDs (third column) across restaurants (first column).

To underscore the potential impact of off-campus dining on the intervention's effectiveness, we provide a detailed map of the EPFL campus that illustrates the proximity of nearby alternative dining options. A fast-food restaurant and a grocery store are located just 51 and 127 meters, respectively, from the nearest campus building, with the farthest buildings being 482 and 558 meters away, corresponding to a maximum walking distance of approximately seven minutes. As most of the campus community is concentrated around the central buildings, these alternatives are typically just a 3-4 minute walk, making off-campus dining a convenient and viable option.\n\nFIG. 6. Comparison of vegeterian ingredients usage in non-MFDs and MFDs. The left panel (A) shows the relative frequency (y-axis) of the top 30 ingredients used for the meal preparation on non-Meat Free days (Non-MFDs). Similarly, the right panel (B) shows the relative frequencies for MFDs. We note a high overlap between the ingredients used in non-MFDs and MFDs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFIG. 7. Campus Map of The EPFL.

The dynamics are like a ball rolling downhill into one of these valleys (fixed points). This works pretty well for retrieval, but a known issue is that there can be other valleys, 'spurious' fixed points, where the ball can get stuck, messing up retrieval.\nThere's this idea that maybe adding asymmetry, breaking that nice symmetric landscape, could help. Some earlier work looking just at the final states \u2013 the fixed points themselves \u2013 seemed to suggest that asymmetry could reduce the number of these unwanted spurious states. That sounds promising! If there are fewer traps, maybe the system is more likely to find a real memory.\nBut retrieval isn't just about *where* the system ends up; it's about *how* it gets there. It's a dynamic process, evolving over time steps. Will adding asymmetry change the path the system takes? The dynamics with asymmetry aren't just following a simple energy gradient anymore. It's a different kind of flow.\nLet's consider what could happen dynamically. Maybe the asymmetry, while reducing the number of fixed point traps, makes the journey towards a memory more erratic or less reliable. Perhaps trajectories that would have led to a memory in the symmetric case are now diverted or even prevented from reaching it. This might actually make it harder to retrieve a memory from certain starting points, potentially shrinking the 'basins of attraction' \u2013 the set of initial states that lead to a particular memory.\nWhat about the speed of convergence? If the system still heads towards memories, does it get there faster or slower? And how does that compare to how quickly it might settle into one of the remaining spurious states? It's plausible that the more complex, non-gradient dynamics introduced by asymmetry could slow things down in general.\nBut maybe there's a positive dynamic effect: what if the asymmetry slows down the convergence to *spurious* states much *more* than it slows down convergence to the desired memory states? If that were the case, even if the probability of ending up in a spurious state isn't totally eliminated, we might be able to tell the difference just by watching how long it takes the network to settle down. If it converges quickly, it's likely a memory; if it takes a long time, it might be a spurious state.\nIt also makes me wonder if analyzing just the first few steps of the dynamics will be enough to understand the long-term behavior. In the symmetric case, sometimes you can predict the final state pretty well from the initial trajectory. But if asymmetry's effects build up over time, maybe the early dynamics won't be a reliable guide to where the system eventually ends up, or how long it takes to get there. The influence of asymmetry might only become significant after several updates, perhaps by introducing correlations across different points in time that aren't present in the simpler, symmetric dynamics.\nSo, while the fixed-point picture might suggest a clear win for asymmetry, the dynamic reality could be more nuanced. It might not universally improve retrieval probability, but could offer other benefits, like a way to distinguish good retrieval from bad based on the time it takes.\n</think>\nIntroducing a random asymmetric component to the synaptic interactions in a Hopfield-like network is likely to significantly alter its dynamic retrieval process compared to the purely symmetric model. While analyses focused solely on the final stable states (fixed points) might suggest that asymmetry reduces undesirable spurious memories, the evolving dynamics could behave differently. The non-gradient nature introduced by asymmetry might potentially reduce the likelihood of converging to a desired memory state from certain initial conditions. However, it's also possible that asymmetry could provide a dynamic advantage, such as differentially slowing down the convergence time to spurious states much more than to memory states, offering a way to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful retrieval based on how quickly the network settles. Understanding these time-dependent effects is crucial, as the influence of asymmetry might not be apparent in the initial steps but could become pronounced over longer timescales, making short-term dynamic approximations potentially unreliable for predicting long-term behavior.", "role": "assistant"}], "entry_type": "single-long", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "q-bio"], "avg_thinking_tokens": 677.0, "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"}

It's community-driven, and the currency is specific to our network, built on a blockchain. This is pretty different from a standard UBI discussion which is usually about state welfare policy.\n\nSo, why would someone join and use this? The obvious draw is the 'basic income' part \u2013 receiving a regular amount of currency unconditionally. That's a direct financial incentive. People might just see it as free money to supplement their income. If that's the main driver, they'd probably just try to spend the currency on whatever they need most, wherever it's accepted in the network. Their behavior might be purely transactional, focused on maximizing the 'Euro value' they get out of the local currency.\n\nBut this isn't *just* a basic income; it's linked to a specific *community* and a set of *values* \u2013 things like challenging state control over money, supporting local economies, maybe even post-capitalist ideals. We're actively trying to build a network of people and businesses who believe in this.\n\nCould it be that for many participants, the primary motivation isn't just the money itself, but identifying with these values or wanting to be part of this alternative community? Maybe they join because they are friends with someone involved, or they hear about the ideals and are inspired.\n\nIf the community and values are strong motivators, how might that influence behavior? People might be more willing to spend the currency at businesses they know are part of the network, even if it's slightly less convenient than using traditional money elsewhere. They might actively participate in community events, not just to spend the currency, but to connect, build trust, and help the network grow. This kind of engagement seems crucial for a local currency system to thrive \u2013 it needs active participation to create a vibrant economic loop.\n\nWhat about the blockchain aspect? It's part of the technology, enabling the decentralized UBI and tracing transactions. But is the technology itself a motivator for most people? My intuition is probably not for the average user. Maybe for a few tech-savvy individuals, but the core appeal is likely either the UBI idea or the community/values. It feels like the tech is an underlying mechanism, less visible or interesting to participants than the social and economic aspects.\n\nSo, I'm hypothesizing that while the UBI provides the initial hook (the 'free money' element), the long-term engagement and active use of the currency within the network might be more strongly correlated with how much individuals identify with the community and its values. This could differentiate participants \u2013 some might be purely transactional 'recipients', while others become active 'community members'. This difference in motivation could significantly impact the network's health and how the currency circulates. The subsidy program for businesses adds another layer \u2013 does that financial incentive override the value-driven motivations for businesses? It feels like understanding these diverse motivations is key to understanding the pilot's actual impact.\n</think>\nBased on this line of thinking, I would anticipate that while the promise of receiving an unconditional basic income provides a strong initial incentive to join such a system, the sustained participation and active use of the local currency within the network will likely be driven more by participants' identification with the project's values and their engagement with the developing community.

We know the final 3D shape, the native state, is key to its function. And it seems widely accepted that the path a protein takes to get there, and how fast it folds, must be related to that native structure's geometry.\n\nBut there's a big question about *which* geometric features matter most for kinetics. Some researchers emphasize the overall arrangement of contacts between amino acids far apart in the sequence \u2013 captured by something like the relative contact order (CO). Others might argue that the sheer size of the protein (N, the number of amino acids) is the dominant factor.\n\nWe're using these simplified computational tools called Go models to study this. The basic idea behind Go models is pretty neat: the lowest energy state in the model is *exactly* the native structure. This means the model is designed to funnel the protein towards its correct shape based purely on its native geometry.\n\nNow, different versions of Go models exist. Some are quite simple, focusing just on attractive forces between amino acids that are in contact in the native state, and repulsive forces otherwise. They might use something like a Lennard-Jones potential. We've worked with versions like this (let's call them A and B internally).\n\nBut what if we add more detail? Model C includes terms that explicitly favor the specific angles (bond angles and dihedral angles) that exist between consecutive amino acids in the native structure. These angles are fundamental to forming local secondary structures like helices and sheets. It feels like making the model respect these local angular preferences should make it a better representation of a real protein's folding landscape.\n\nSo, my big question is, how does this increased realism in capturing local structure via angular terms in Model C influence what we see in folding simulations? Specifically, does it change how folding time relates to protein size (N) or to the relative contact order (CO)?\n\nMy intuition is that adding these angular terms should reinforce the formation of native-like local structures early in the folding process.

So, the mathematical models used for epidemics on graphs seem like a good starting point.

So, the challenge is: how do we modify the spherical model to recover that essential retrieval phase without destroying the simplicity gained by going spherical? The text suggests adding something to the Hamiltonian, specifically a term dependent on the retrieval order parameter, maybe something that penalizes states where the retrieval overlap is zero or small.\n</think>\nA simple spherical version of the model, by just changing the neuron variables to be continuous under a spherical constraint, appears to lose the essential retrieval phase characteristic of the standard Hopfield model.

So, it seems we are adding a term proportional to some power of m, and the text specifies it's a quartic term. This term must be designed such that it stabilizes or favors configurations where m is non-zero, effectively creating a potential energy landscape that includes minima corresponding to the stored patterns.

It directly interacts with the 'retrieval overlap order parameter', which quantifies the similarity between the current state of the neurons and a stored pattern.

I can think of a couple of opposing forces. On one hand, if getting Medicaid means the child is healthier or that the family doesn't have to worry as much about unexpected medical bills or affording private insurance, the mother might feel more able to focus on work. A healthier child might require less time off for appointments or care. This could encourage her to work more hours or seek employment if she wasn't working. On the other hand, having children covered by Medicaid effectively frees up some family income that might have otherwise gone to healthcare costs. This is like an increase in disposable income. When people have more non-wage income, they sometimes choose to work less because they don't need the earnings as much. Also, because Medicaid is typically for lower-income families, mothers might worry that if they increase their hours or earnings too much, their child could lose eligibility for this crucial health coverage. This could create an incentive to keep earnings low or stable. So, it's not immediately clear whether the net effect would be an increase or decrease in work effort.\n</think>\nThere appear to be competing mechanisms at play. One possibility is that improved child health or reduced financial burden from healthcare costs (like not needing private insurance or paying out-of-pocket) could enable mothers to increase their labor supply. Conversely, the effective increase in family resources due to reduced healthcare expenditures, or the potential for losing means-tested eligibility if earnings rise, could lead mothers to reduce their work hours or participation.

A single mother is often the sole provider for her family. Her income is critical for meeting basic needs. So, the financial relief or potential health benefits from her child having Medicaid might primarily free her up to increase her earnings and hours, as her need for income is likely higher and more direct. For a married mother, there's typically a partner's income contributing to the household. The financial need might not be as acute or solely dependent on her earnings. In this case, the 'income effect' \u2013 feeling less pressure to earn because healthcare costs are covered \u2013 or the incentive to stay below certain income thresholds to maintain eligibility might be more influential, potentially leading her to reduce her labor supply. It seems reasonable to hypothesize different responses based on marital status because their underlying economic constraints and incentives related to income and program eligibility are quite different.\n</think>\nIt's plausible that the effect would differ.

As you increase the DNA concentration, the molecules are closer on average. More importantly, each DNA molecule will 'capture' or 'condense' some number of these multivalent ions around it. If each DNA molecule takes up a certain amount of the multivalent ions that are added, then to maintain the necessary concentration of 'free' or 'bulk' multivalent ions *between* the DNA molecules to induce aggregation, you'd need to add more total multivalent ions as you increase the DNA concentration.

A common analogy is how a disease or virus spreads \u2013 it essentially jumps from one person to anyone they have contact with, provided they are susceptible. It's largely indiscriminate; the virus doesn't care if you're interested in it, just if you're a viable host.\nBut information is different. People don't just forward every email or repeat every conversation they have. They make choices based on what they think is relevant or interesting, both to themselves and to the person they're communicating with. This immediately tells me that information spread isn't like an indiscriminate virus.\nWhy would someone think information is relevant to one person but not another? It seems intuitive that shared interests, common work projects, or similar social contexts would make information more relevant. In social networks, we tend to be more closely connected to people who are similar to us \u2013 this idea is called homophily. Conversely, people who are socially or organizationally distant from us are probably less likely to share our specific interests or need the same kind of information.\nSo, if I'm thinking about passing a piece of information along, my probability of doing so might be higher for someone I'm close to socially (because we have more in common and I know their interests) and lower for someone who is distant (because we have less in common, and the information is less likely to be relevant to them). This suggests that the likelihood of a piece of information being transmitted might decay somehow as the social or organizational distance from the original source increases.\nNow, how does this decay in transmission probability interact with the network structure? If I'm in a network where transmission is indiscriminate, like a virus, even a low probability of transmission can eventually lead to a widespread outbreak, especially in certain network types like those with power-law degree distributions (scale-free networks) where there are highly connected individuals who can spread things broadly. It feels like there might not be a minimum threshold needed for something to spread widely in those cases.\nBut if the probability of passing information on decreases significantly with distance, then even if a piece of information starts at a highly connected person, its ability to jump across different social circles or organizational boundaries might be limited. The connections to distant parts of the network, even if they exist, become less effective pathways for that specific piece of information because the people at the end of those paths are less likely to be interested or to pass it further.\nThis suggests that the selective nature of information, leading to this distance-based decay in transmissibility, could create an effective 'barrier' to widespread diffusion that doesn't exist for something like a virus. Instead of potentially reaching a large fraction of the network, the information might tend to stay localized within smaller, more cohesive groups where interests are more aligned and transmission probabilities remain high. Therefore, even in a network structure theoretically capable of supporting large outbreaks, the inherent characteristics of information and human social connection could limit its overall reach.\n</think>\nThe spread of information, unlike that of an indiscriminate virus, is significantly influenced by its selective nature and the structure of social connections. Because individuals tend to share information based on perceived relevance, and relevance often decreases with social or organizational distance (due to factors like homophily), the probability of information transmission likely decays across the network.

We want to keep the model mathematically tractable, hopefully benefiting from the continuous nature. A simple additional term in the Hamiltonian might work. It should probably involve the relationship between the current state of the system and the stored memories, maybe the 'overlap' with a specific memory. If we add a term that penalizes states that *aren't* close to a memory, or rewards states that *are* close, that might create the necessary structure.\n\nThe text mentions adding a 'quartic' term. This means it involves the state variables raised to the power of four. This is a simple non-linear term. Could a quartic term, perhaps related to the squared overlap with a pattern, create the necessary energy landscape? It seems plausible. It could introduce sharper minima corresponding to the stored patterns without breaking the spherical symmetry or making the equilibrium calculations impossible. Maybe this specific form, a quartic term involving the retrieval overlap, is the key.\n\nIf we add this term, will the system now have retrieval states? The hope is yes. If it does, we can then analyze its thermodynamics \u2013 finding the stable states at different temperatures and storage levels. Will this analysis be simplified by the spherical constraint and the chosen form of the added term? It's suggested it might be 'exactly solvable' and 'replica symmetric', which is great for understanding. And if the system retrieves, how does it get there? We'd need to study its dynamics. A standard approach is Langevin dynamics, which models the system's evolution under the influence of its energy function and some noise. This should show if the system naturally flows into the retrieval states when initialized nearby. The long-term dynamics should ideally match the thermodynamic predictions.\n\nSo, the addition of this quartic term feels like a crucial modification. It's there specifically to restore the retrieval property that was lost by making the units continuous. Without it, the model wouldn't be useful as an associative memory. With it, we potentially gain a mathematically cleaner model for studying memory retrieval, its phases, and its dynamics, perhaps even revealing better stability properties compared to the standard binary version.\n</think>\nThe standard spherical version of the associative memory model, without modification, does not exhibit a retrieval phase because the continuous nature of the units doesn't inherently create stable attractor states for the stored patterns. Adding a specific quartic potential term, which interacts with the 'overlap' parameter measuring similarity to a stored pattern, is hypothesized to modify the model's energy landscape, reintroducing stable states corresponding to the stored memories. This crucial addition enables the model to perform associative recall and also facilitates a more tractable analysis of its thermodynamic properties and dynamic evolution towards these memory states.", "role": "assistant"}], "entry_type": "single-long", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "q-bio"], "avg_thinking_tokens": 707.0, "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"}

The text suggests that positively charged multivalent ions, like spermine, are key to this process. They must somehow neutralize or bridge the negative charges on the DNA backbones to overcome the repulsion and allow attraction.\nThere seems to be a specific concentration of these multivalent ions that, when reached in the solution, triggers the onset of aggregation \u2013 this is the threshold concentration we're interested in.\nWhat factors might affect this threshold? Let's consider the environment around the DNA strands. The negative charge of the DNA attracts positive ions from the surrounding solution. These ions form a sort of cloud or layer around the DNA. This cloud contains both the multivalent ions we're adding and any monovalent ions (like sodium from added salt) that are also present.\nThe idea is that aggregation probably starts when the *local* conditions right next to the DNA surface are just right \u2013 perhaps when enough multivalent ions have accumulated there to effectively screen the repulsion or create attractive forces. It seems plausible that the *bulk* concentrations of the ions in the solution are in equilibrium with these *local* concentrations near the DNA.\nNow, think about the DNA concentration itself.

The text describes how multivalent cations, like spermine, cause DNA strands to clump together. It also mentions the role of monovalent salt and how it affects the system. The question is about how the concentrations of DNA and monovalent salt influence the threshold concentration of multivalent ions required for aggregation.\nFrom the description, it sounds like the threshold concentration of the multivalent cation depends on achieving a critical environment around the DNA. Imagine the DNA strands as negatively charged rods. The multivalent positive ions are strongly attracted to these negative charges. The monovalent positive ions are also attracted, but less strongly.\nWhen we add multivalent ions to the solution, they will be drawn towards the DNA, essentially ", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<think>\nThe user is asking about the relationship between the various concentrations in this experiment: the DNA concentration (cDNA), the multivalent ion concentration threshold at which aggregation begins (c<sub>z,aggr</sub>), and the background monovalent salt concentration (cs). Based on the text's description, it seems the aggregation of DNA by multivalent cations is triggered by a critical balance of ions around the negatively charged DNA backbone. It's not just about having a certain bulk concentration of multivalent ions, but rather about how many multivalent ions are available *specifically near the DNA*. These local concentrations are influenced by the ion concentrations in the rest of the solution.\nLet's consider how each concentration might play a role. The DNA backbone has a fixed negative charge. Positive ions are attracted to it to neutralize this charge. Multivalent ions, with their higher charge, are more effective at screening the strong repulsive forces between the negatively charged DNA strands than monovalent ions. So, we'd expect that increasing the concentration of multivalent ions would eventually overcome the repulsion and lead to aggregation. There must be some critical amount of multivalent ions needed near the DNA to cause the strands to attract rather than repel.\nNow, how does the total DNA concentration influence this threshold of added multivalent ions? If there's more DNA in the solution, there are more negatively charged sites requiring neutralization and ion accumulation. To achieve the same critical local concentration of multivalent ions around *each* DNA molecule, we would intuitively need to add a larger *total* amount of multivalent ions to the overall solution. So, I'd expect the threshold concentration of *added* multivalent ions to increase as the DNA concentration increases, because more ions are needed to coat or interact with the larger amount of DNA. The text mentions a linear relationship between the aggregation threshold multivalent concentration and the DNA concentration for a certain range of DNA concentrations, suggesting this idea is reasonable.\nWhat about the monovalent salt concentration? Monovalent ions are also attracted to the negatively charged DNA, although less strongly than multivalent ions. They will be competing with the multivalent ions for space near the DNA backbone. If there's a high concentration of monovalent salt, a significant portion of the negative charge on the DNA might be screened by these less effective monovalent ions. To then reach the critical *local* concentration of multivalent ions needed for aggregation, we might have to add a higher *bulk* concentration of multivalent ions to displace or outcompete the monovalent ions and ensure enough multivalent ions are present near the DNA. So, I would expect the multivalent ion aggregation threshold to also increase as the monovalent salt concentration increases.\nIt seems the threshold is ultimately determined by the bulk concentrations of both types of counterions, as these dictate the local ion environment around the DNA. The relationship described in the text for the low DNA concentration regime, c<sub>z,aggr</sub> = \u03b1c<sub>DNA</sub> + \u03b2, where \u03b2 is the bulk concentration far from the DNA and \u03b1 accounts for the excess ions near each chain, captures this intuition that the total amount of multivalent ions needed depends on the DNA quantity and the background bulk concentration. The fact that \u03b2 (the intercept, related to the bulk concentration needed at zero DNA) changes with monovalent salt concentration further supports the idea that monovalent salt concentration shifts the overall landscape of ion concentrations needed to reach the aggregation point.\nIn summary, increasing either the DNA concentration or the monovalent salt concentration should require a higher concentration of multivalent ions to reach the point where DNA aggregation begins.\n</think>\nThe multivalent ion concentration required to initiate DNA aggregation appears to depend on both the concentration of DNA and the background concentration of monovalent salt. Increasing the DNA concentration likely increases the demand for multivalent ions to accumulate around each strand, thus raising the overall threshold concentration needed in the solution. Similarly, increasing the monovalent salt concentration introduces more competing ions that interact with the DNA, potentially requiring a higher bulk concentration of multivalent ions to achieve the critical local conditions necessary for aggregation.", "role": "assistant"}], "entry_type": "single-long", "categories": ["cond-mat.soft", "cond-mat.stat-mech", "physics.bio-ph", "q-bio"], "avg_thinking_tokens": 511.5, "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"}

There's this system, the Minimum Support Price (MSP), where the government guarantees a floor price for certain crops. This is great for farmers because it protects them if market prices crash. It's kind of like the government is providing free price insurance. But this also means the government bears all the financial risk when prices fall below that guaranteed level.\nNow, we know that agricultural markets are heavily influenced by climate \u2013 temperature, rainfall patterns, extreme weather events. And climate patterns seem to be becoming more unpredictable. This increasing variability in climate could lead to more frequent or more severe instances where market prices fall significantly below the MSP, placing a growing and uncertain financial burden on the government.\nWhat if the government didn't just absorb all this risk directly? What if it acted more like someone managing a portfolio of risks? It seems plausible that the government could transfer some of this risk to others, perhaps through some form of insurance. If the government purchased a large-scale insurance policy that paid out when the market price dropped below the MSP, it could cap its direct costs. For example, it could decide it will cover the first portion of the cost itself, but anything beyond a certain threshold is covered by the insurance.\nThis could offer several potential benefits. First, it could make the government's expenditure on supporting prices more predictable, improving fiscal planning. Second, it shifts some of the potentially large, unpredictable costs to insurance providers who are in the business of pooling and managing risk. This could be a more sustainable model in the long run, especially as climate impacts grow.\nBut how would such insurance be priced? Insurance premiums depend on the likelihood and potential size of payouts, which in this case are linked to how often and how much market prices fall below the MSP. And, as we noted, price volatility is strongly tied to climate variability. So, to accurately price this insurance, the insurers would need to understand and forecast how future climate conditions might affect agricultural yields and, consequently, market price volatility.\nThis suggests we would need sophisticated models that can link climate projections (like different future warming scenarios) to estimates of future price volatility. This predicted volatility could then be fed into a financial model, much like pricing a put option, to calculate a fair premium for the insurance policy. A big challenge here would be the accuracy of these climate-informed volatility forecasts, especially over longer time horizons. Getting the data right \u2013 both historical climate and price data, and future climate scenarios \u2013 and building robust models to capture the complex, potentially non-linear relationship between climate shocks and price swings would be critical. There might also be challenges in encouraging the private insurance sector to offer such policies at a large scale for commodities, and figuring out how to best structure the relationship between the government, farmers, and insurers. But if successful, it could lead to a more resilient and sustainable system for supporting farmers in the face of climate change.\n</think>\nA government strategy to hedge Minimum Support Price costs by purchasing climate-informed crop insurance could offer fiscal stability by making expenditures more predictable and shifting unpredictable climate-related financial risks to insurers. This approach, however, requires accurate modeling to link future climate scenarios to agricultural price volatility forecasts, which would be used to price the insurance premiums effectively.

But the sense I'm getting is that competing directly with future electricity sources, which will likely be dominated by cheaper, intermittent renewables, might be tough for fusion, especially with its expected high capital costs initially. I need to think about other ways fusion could provide value. A huge part of global energy use is heat, particularly for industrial processes, and decarbonizing that seems really difficult. Fusion naturally produces energy as heat when the high-energy neutrons from the reaction hit a surrounding blanket. The standard path is to use this heat to boil water or heat another fluid and run a turbine to make electricity. But that conversion process isn't perfectly efficient \u2013 thermodynamics imposes limits, and there's also the plant's own internal electricity needs (recirculation) that eat into the net output. What if, instead of converting all that heat to electricity, we could sell a significant portion of it directly to industries that need it? Bypassing the thermal-to-electric conversion stage would mean less energy is lost in that step. Also, if the heat customer can use the thermal energy directly, maybe the fusion plant needs to generate less internal electricity, reducing the recirculation power requirement and freeing up even more primary energy to sell as heat. It seems plausible that if the need for high-temperature heat is great and hard to meet otherwise, the value or effective price for that heat could be quite high. Compared to the potentially volatile and perhaps lower prices for electricity in a future grid with lots of intermittent sources, a stable, high-value market for heat could provide a much stronger, perhaps more predictable, revenue stream. This potential for increased profitability by sidestepping inefficient conversion and accessing a high-value market could significantly improve the overall financial case for building and operating a fusion plant. It might be a way to make fusion more commercially viable sooner, helping it overcome its initial cost hurdles and find its place in the future energy mix, particularly by serving specific, demanding industrial needs that are difficult to address with other clean energy sources.

The standard way to think about this is often by modeling the particle as a simple sphere, maybe with a few layers or shells, and considering it in isolation or perhaps just accounting for simple dipole interactions when other particles are nearby. But biological cells and many colloidal particles aren't uniform internally; their electrical properties like conductivity and dielectric constant can vary gradually from the core outwards. Let's call this internal variation 'gradation' or 'inhomogeneity'.\n\nFirst, consider the effect of this internal gradation on an individual particle's response to an AC field. When an external field is applied, charges within the particle redistribute, causing polarization. If the internal properties are graded, this charge redistribution and the resulting dipole moment might be different compared to a particle with uniform properties or distinct shells. I would expect the specific nature of the gradient to affect the frequency-dependent polarization response \u2013 potentially shifting the characteristic frequencies where the particle rotates most strongly (in electrorotation) or is pulled most effectively by a non-uniform field (in dielectrophoresis), or changing the magnitude of these effects. The particle's 'spectrum' of response across different frequencies would be a signature of its internal structure.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens when two of these particles are very close to each other, specifically touching. When they are far apart, treating them as point dipoles might be okay. But when they touch, the electric field lines around one polarized particle are strongly distorted by the presence of the other touching particle. This interaction goes beyond a simple dipole-dipole effect. It involves higher-order multipoles induced in each particle by the presence of the other, a complex mutual polarization process that can be thought of as a series of 'image' charges or dipoles induced back and forth between the particles. These 'multipolar interactions' or 'multiple images' fundamentally alter the effective polarization of each particle within the pair compared to an isolated one.\n\nHow would this affect their electrokinetic behavior? If the effective dipole moment of a particle in a touching pair is different from that of an isolated particle (or one treated with a simple dipole approximation), then the torque experienced in a rotating field or the force experienced in a non-uniform field will change accordingly. I'd anticipate that these multipolar effects would be most significant when the particles are in very close proximity, like touching. This could potentially lead to new features in the ER/DEP spectra, like additional peaks or shifts in the existing ones, or changes in the overall strength of the rotational or translational response, particularly at certain frequencies. For instance, the mutual interaction might make it easier or harder for the pair to rotate or move in a particular direction depending on the field orientation relative to the line connecting their centers.\n\nWhy is understanding these effects important? Many practical applications of AC electrokinetics, like sorting cells or manipulating particles, involve concentrated suspensions where particles are close together or tend to aggregate and touch under the influence of the field. If we rely on models that ignore internal gradation or only consider simple dipole interactions for touching particles, our predictions for their behavior might be inaccurate. This could lead to errors in identifying different particle types based on their measured spectra or designing inefficient devices. By developing a theory that explicitly incorporates both the internal graded structure and the complex multipolar interactions when particles touch, we should be able to more accurately predict and understand their electrokinetic behavior in realistic scenarios, which is crucial for improving cell manipulation and analysis technologies.\n</think>\nThe electrokinetic behavior (rotation and movement) of biological cells or colloidal particles in AC electric fields is significantly influenced by both their internal graded electrical properties and the complex multipolar interactions that occur when they are in close contact. Internal gradation causes the particle's polarization response across frequencies to differ from that of homogeneous or simple shell models. When particles touch, mutual polarization effects captured by multipolar interactions drastically change their effective dipole moments compared to isolated particles, altering the torque and force they experience.

What are some common shortcuts or simplifications in other models that don't seem quite right biologically, and how might they cause problems? I've heard some models use 'extremal dynamics', where they just force a fixed number of neurons to fire, usually the ones with the highest activation. That doesn't sound very biological; a real neuron fires if its internal potential crosses a threshold, not because it's competing with others in its layer for a fixed quota. Fixing the number of active neurons also limits the range of possible output patterns the network can produce. Another approach I've seen is constantly adjusting the firing thresholds of neurons during learning. While thresholds might adapt in reality, perhaps doing it artificially at every single step just to keep activity levels in check isn't the most natural way. It feels like a manual control knob. If we don't use these artificial controls, though, how do we stop the network's activity from spiraling out of control \u2013 either becoming completely silent or having all neurons constantly firing? This seems like a core challenge that needs a more intrinsic, learning-rule-based solution.\n</think>\nSome simplified neural network models employ mechanisms that don't align well with biological observations, such as forcing a fixed number of neurons to be active (extremal dynamics), which limits the potential output states and isn't based on individual neuron firing thresholds. Others might artificially adjust neuron thresholds throughout the learning process specifically to manage overall network activity. Without such imposed controls, a key challenge is preventing the network from naturally drifting into states of either excessive or insufficient activity, where it might become stuck or non-functional.

How can this global signal influence the learning at the level of individual connections (synapses)? The signal is global, but learning happens locally at each synapse. It seems like the learning rule for each synapse must somehow combine this global feedback with information available right there at the synapse \u2013 like whether the connected neurons are active or their internal states. The feedback signal essentially tells the network whether its current collective action was good or bad. If it was good, we want to reinforce whatever the network just did. If it was bad, we need to change things up so it doesn't repeat the mistake and can explore other options.

We also think the direction of the weight change (increase or decrease) depends on the global feedback and the local states of the connected neurons. And critically, for any given feedback state (right or wrong), there must be the possibility of both increasing and decreasing weights; otherwise, all weights might just grow or shrink indefinitely, which isn't good for dynamic activity. What if the sign of the change depends just on the combination of the two neuron's states and the feedback? If the presynaptic neuron is active, and the postsynaptic neuron is also active, and the feedback is positive (rewarding), you'd intuitively want to strengthen that connection \u2013 that sounds like a classic Hebbian idea ('neurons that fire together, wire together'). What if the feedback is negative (punishing)? If both are active, but the outcome was wrong, maybe you want to weaken that connection? That feels like an 'Anti-Hebbian' process. What if one is active and the other isn't? The sign rule suggests that if the change can be positive when both are active, it must be negative when the postsynaptic one isn't (assuming the presynaptic is active).

So, it makes sense that the 'right' feedback would trigger Hebbian-like updates, effectively 'engraving' the successful input-output mapping into the network's weights. This should make the network more likely to produce that same correct output if given the same input again, and potentially make the learned association more robust. Conversely, if the output is *wrong*, we need the network to change its behavior for that input. Anti-Hebbian learning weakens connections based on activity. If the 'wrong' feedback triggers Anti-Hebbian updates, it should disrupt the current pattern of activity and the weights that caused it, making it less likely to produce the *same* wrong output next time and encouraging it to explore different output states until the correct one is found.

The rule should depend on local information: the pre-synaptic neuron's state (must be active for change) and the post-synaptic neuron's state. It also needs to be related to the strength of the connection itself somehow, perhaps the current weight or the neuron's potential/threshold, as these are local variables. A simple approach, lacking strong biological specifics for the *punishment* part, might just involve constants scaled by the local neural states. For example, the change could be a negative value determined by a constant, but perhaps that value is different depending on whether the post-synaptic neuron was active or not when the wrong output occurred. The hope is that this specific form of Anti-Hebbian adjustment, applied repeatedly when the network is wrong, won't just randomly change weights, but will have a beneficial side effect: automatically keeping the overall level of neuron activity in the network from getting stuck too high or too low. If it works, it would be great because it solves that activity regulation problem intrinsically via the learning rule itself, rather than needing those artificial mechanisms we discussed earlier.\n</think>\nA specific form for the Anti-Hebbian learning rule, particularly when detailed biological mechanisms for punishment are less clear, could be relatively simple, perhaps involving constants that scale the weight change based on the local states of the connected neurons (e.g., whether the postsynaptic neuron was active or inactive when the error occurred), provided the presynaptic neuron was active. The specific hope for a carefully chosen Anti-Hebbian rule is that, beyond enabling the network to change away from incorrect outputs, it will also inherently regulate the average firing activity of the neurons, keeping it within a functional range without needing external control mechanisms or adaptive thresholds.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "Could the physical structure of the network, specifically how interconnected the neurons are, play a role in its ability to learn, especially if neurons have non-zero firing thresholds?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<think>\nWe've been thinking about learning rules, but what about the network's wiring? Most models start with every neuron in one layer connected to every neuron in the next (a 'dense' network). But real brains aren't like that; they are 'diluted', meaning many possible connections are missing. Does this matter? If neurons have a specific potential threshold they need to reach to fire, and their input is a sum of signals from connected neurons, the number and strength of connections really influence that sum. If a layer of neurons is too densely connected, especially with non-zero thresholds, could the inputs they receive become highly correlated? Like, if one neuron gets a strong input driving it towards threshold, many other neurons connected to the same set of pre-synaptic neurons might also get similar strong inputs. This could lead to unwanted correlations in firing patterns \u2013 maybe all neurons in a layer tend to fire together or stay silent together, reducing the diversity of possible internal states and outputs. If dilution means fewer shared inputs between neurons, perhaps it could break up these unwanted correlations, allowing for a wider range of responses and better performance, especially when thresholds are part of the firing mechanism.\n</think>\nThe degree of interconnectedness, or 'dilution', within the network could significantly impact learning performance, particularly when neurons have non-zero firing thresholds. In a densely connected network, multiple neurons in a layer might receive similar inputs from the preceding layer, potentially leading to highly correlated activity patterns where neurons tend to fire or remain quiescent together. This reduces the diversity of the network's internal states and possible outputs. Introducing dilution, meaning removing a fraction of these connections, could help decorrelate the inputs received by different neurons.

Just saying it works isn't enough; we need a quantitative measure. The goal is to learn a set of input-output pairs. We present an input, and the network tries to produce the desired output. If it's wrong, we update weights (punishment); if it's right, we reinforce (reward), and move to the next pair (or repeat the current one until it's right). The learning process is complete when the network can produce the correct output for *all* the input patterns in our target set, ideally without needing many attempts for each. So, a natural measure would be the total number of trials or updates required to reach this state where all pairs are 'learned'. But just the raw number isn't that informative on its own. We need something to compare it to. What's the theoretical minimum effort? If the network just guessed randomly until it got the right output for each input, how many trials would that take on average? That random chance level could serve as a baseline. So, maybe a good performance measure is the ratio of this theoretical random-guess time to the actual time it takes our network. A value close to 1 would mean our learning is no better than chance (bad), while a value much less than 1 would mean our learning rule is effective (good). Or perhaps, maybe a ratio of the random time *divided by* the actual time, so higher is better? Yes, that makes more sense. Performance is the random chance time divided by the actual learning time. If actual time is much larger than random, performance is low. If actual time is close to random (e.g., for a very simple task, maybe you get it right on the first try which is like random chance), performance is high, near 1.\n</think>\nTo assess the network's learning capability quantitatively, we could measure the total number of attempts or trials required for it to successfully produce the correct output for every input pattern in a predefined set. To make this measure meaningful, we can compare it to a theoretical baseline: the average number of trials it would take to achieve the same outcome purely by random chance, if the network were simply guessing outputs with a certain probability distribution. A measure of performance could then be the ratio of this theoretical random learning time to the actual learning time taken by our network.

These likely play big roles in dynamics and learning. Also, our feedback is super simple: just right or wrong. What if the feedback was more nuanced, maybe a value indicating *how close* the output was, or a continuous reward signal? That could provide richer information for learning. Neurons themselves are more complex than our simple binary model; they have refractory periods (can't fire immediately after firing) and signals take time to travel (time delays). Synapses aren't all the same either; there are excitatory and inhibitory ones, and maybe their learning rules differ.

The mention of \"stochastic resonance\" implies that the system might preferentially respond to certain aspects of the random noise in a way that aligns with this angled structure. Perhaps the collision process itself, when combined with the inclined spring, acts like a rectifier or a ratchet, favoring movement in one direction while hindering or not producing equivalent kicks in the opposite direction.

We're trying to make it learn associations between input patterns and desired output patterns.\nThe neurons have a threshold: their internal potential has to exceed a certain value for them to become active (fire). This seems like a basic, biologically realistic feature.\nWe're also considering networks where not every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. There's some probability, or \"dilution,\" that a connection is missing.\nMy initial intuition might be that more connections are always better for learning. More pathways, more potential for complex interactions to store information. A fully connected network (zero dilution) seems like it would have the maximum capacity.\nHowever, if neurons have non-zero thresholds, maybe having too many connections causes a problem?\nLet's think about the output layer. The state of neurons in the output layer depends on the states of neurons in the hidden layer and the weights of the connections. If the hidden layer neurons tend to fire together or are strongly interconnected, and if the output neurons receive input from *many* of these strongly correlated hidden neurons (low dilution), their potentials might also become highly correlated.\nIf the potentials are highly correlated, and there's a threshold to cross, it seems like output neurons might tend to either *all* cross the threshold together (all fire) or *all* fail to cross it (none fire).\nThis would mean the network output is highly restricted \u2013 perhaps mostly just the all-active or all-inactive states. This severely limits the number of distinct output patterns the network can produce. If the desired output patterns include a wide variety of sparse or mixed activity states, a network stuck producing only all-or-nothing outputs would struggle to learn them.\nWhat if we introduce dilution? If an output neuron only receives connections from a *subset* of the hidden layer neurons, and these subsets are different for different output neurons (which is more likely with higher dilution), then the input potentials to the output neurons might become less correlated with each other.\nIf the inputs are less correlated, then whether a specific output neuron crosses its threshold might become more independent of whether other output neurons cross theirs.\nThis increased independence in firing decisions between output neurons could allow the network to generate a much wider variety of output patterns \u2013 patterns with only a few neurons active, or a mixed set.\nSo, perhaps introducing dilution acts as a kind of \"decorrelator\" for the neuron potentials when thresholds are present. It might break up the tendency for the entire layer to behave as a single unit.\nThis suggests a hypothesis: for networks with non-zero thresholds, there might be an optimal level of dilution. Too little dilution leads to excessive correlation and limited output variety (poor performance). Too much dilution might mean too little information transfer to support learning. But some intermediate level of sparsity could be crucial for unlocking the network's ability to represent diverse output patterns.\nTherefore, having a diluted structure, counter-intuitively, might enhance the network's capacity to perform its task when thresholds are active, by allowing for more diverse output states.\n</think>\nBased on this line of reasoning, it appears that in a neural network model where neurons have non-zero firing thresholds, a certain level of sparseness or \"dilution\" in the connections might be beneficial, perhaps even necessary, for effectively learning various input-output relationships. This is because dilution could help reduce undesired correlations in neuronal activity that might otherwise restrict the network to producing only a limited set of output patterns.", "role": "assistant"}], "entry_type": "single-long", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "q-bio"], "avg_thinking_tokens": 647.0, "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"}

The standard approach, which has been around for a long time, models portfolio variance as a quadratic function of the proportions invested in each asset. This is neat and mathematically tractable, forming the basis for finding optimal portfolios.\n\nBut there's this underlying assumption that might be too simple: that the volume of trades in each security, which is a real-world market characteristic, doesn't significantly impact this variance calculation, or that it can be treated as constant. In reality, we know trade volumes fluctuate a lot, driven by all sorts of factors \u2013 market news, investor sentiment, liquidity needs, etc.\n\nWhat if this randomness in trade volumes isn't negligible? If we incorporate the fact that the number or value of shares being traded is itself a random variable, how would that change our understanding of portfolio variance?\n\nIt seems intuitive that if you're dealing with significant amounts of an asset, the dynamics of trading that asset \u2013 including how much is traded at any given time \u2013 could affect its price movements and, consequently, the overall portfolio's value fluctuations. If trade volumes are random, and they influence prices or if the execution of trades at certain volumes impacts the observed price, then this randomness should probably be reflected in the portfolio's risk measure.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the traditional quadratic formula for variance might be an oversimplification, essentially valid only in an idealized scenario where trade volumes are fixed. If we account for random volumes, the relationship between asset allocation and portfolio variance is likely more complex.\n\nInstead of just depending on the simple pairwise covariances of asset returns (which are often derived implicitly assuming fixed volumes or just looking at price series), the variance might also depend on the variability of the trade volumes themselves and potentially the covariance *between* trade volumes and prices, or even volumes of different assets.\n\nThis would mean the variance formula would involve higher-order terms related to the asset allocation percentages, maybe even up to the fourth power, reflecting these more intricate interactions involving volume randomness.

What makes a financial asset, like a bond or a stock, actually *work*? It seems to boil down to a promise \u2013 a promise that someone will pay you back, or give you a share of profits, or something similar, often conditional on future events. In traditional finance, the credibility and enforcement of these promises are absolutely critical. And historically, this has relied heavily on the legal system \u2013 the courts, the ability of the state to enforce contracts, even its monopoly on force as a last resort. This seems like the bedrock: trust in the legal framework to make sure promises are kept.\nNow, what happens when we introduce something like blockchain? The core idea here is a different way to handle these promises. Instead of relying on a judge or a government, the promises are essentially embedded in code \u2013 smart contracts \u2013 and their execution is verified and guaranteed by a decentralized network of participants (miners or validators). It's a system where the network, through cryptography and consensus mechanisms, enforces the terms automatically, with minimal discretion.\nSo, the fundamental difference feels like a shift in the *enforcement mechanism* for promises. From a centralized, human-governed, legal system to a decentralized, automated, code-governed technological system. What could this imply?\nIf a technological system can reliably enforce promises, maybe we don't need all the traditional intermediaries that exist primarily to manage counterparty risk and ensure compliance within the legal framework. Could platforms for trading, lending, or even complex derivatives become purely code-based, running on a blockchain? This could potentially make financial services faster, cheaper, and accessible to anyone with an internet connection, bypassing geographical limitations or the need for established legal infrastructure.\nThis also raises questions about the role of governments and regulators. If transactions and contracts are enforced by code on a global network, how do national regulations apply? How do we handle issues like illegal activities if identities are obscured? How do we ensure stability and investor protection without traditional oversight? It seems like it forces a rethinking of regulation itself \u2013 perhaps moving towards systems that are somehow embedded within the technology.\nThere are also practical challenges the technology needs to overcome. Is this decentralized validation truly scalable and energy-efficient enough? How are price discrepancies handled across different parts of this new market? How do we value new types of digital assets (like NFTs, which represent unique digital property) and build robust markets around them, including derivatives for hedging?\nUltimately, it seems like the future might not be a complete replacement, at least not in places where the traditional system works reasonably well. But the possibility exists for a parallel system, or perhaps a hybrid where traditional financial institutions start building on top of this new technological foundation. The most significant impact could be in areas where the traditional legal system is weak, or for services that can be automated more efficiently by code. The market for promises might still exist, but the way those promises are guaranteed and exchanged could be profoundly different, moving towards something more transparent and automated, provided the significant challenges can be addressed.\n</think>\nThe fundamental distinction between traditional finance and a blockchain-based system lies in how promises are enforced. Traditional finance relies on a centralized legal and judicial system to guarantee contracts and manage counterparty risk. In contrast, a blockchain-based system enforces promises through decentralized validation by a network and automated execution via smart contracts.

If the prices for different animals change, or the relative ease of catching them changes (maybe as some become rarer), how does that affect what they choose to hunt? Simple economic models, like looking at the trade-offs in production (Production Possibilities Frontier) and comparing them to market values (isorevenue lines), should offer insights into why hunters make the decisions they do and whether those decisions lead to outcomes that are 'efficient' from an economic perspective, at least in the short term.\n</think>\nYes, economic analysis can provide valuable insights.

The surprising thing seems to be that when tension is applied, the DNA doesn't just peel off smoothly or gradually as the force increases. Instead, it appears to stay wrapped up to a certain critical force, and then large sections or even whole turns seem to detach suddenly and all at once. And this sudden release happens in discrete steps or 'packets'. This is unexpected because you might think a continuous increase in force would lead to a continuous unwrapping. Why the suddenness and the quantization?\n</think>\nThese experiments reveal a surprising behavior: instead of gradual unwrapping in response to increasing tension, DNA appears to detach from spools in a sudden, discontinuous manner, often releasing discrete segments or turns at specific critical force thresholds.

As I pull harder, more length would detach, smoothly. The fact that it's sudden suggests there's something more dynamic or mechanical happening as the DNA comes off. It's not just the energy *on* the surface, but the energy cost or landscape associated with the *process* of moving from a wrapped state to an unwrapped state while under tension. This process involves more than just breaking adsorption bonds; it involves changing the shape of the DNA that's leaving the spool and potentially the orientation of the spool itself.\n</think>\nA simple view focusing only on the energy required to detach DNA from the spool surface (adsorption energy) would likely predict a more gradual unwrapping process as tension increases. The observed suddenness and quantization suggest that the dynamics of unwrapping involve more complex factors, such as mechanical resistance arising from the DNA's stiffness or geometrical constraints during the detachment process, which aren't captured by just considering the static binding energy.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "What physical factors, beyond simple adsorption energy, could contribute to a resistance or barrier to unwrapping under tension?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<think>\nThinking about the mechanics, when I pull on the ends of the wrapped DNA, the segments coming off the spool aren't just straight lines; they have to follow a path away from the core. This likely involves bending the DNA, especially near the point where it leaves the spool surface. DNA is stiff, and bending it requires energy. Also, because the DNA is wrapped helically, pulling on the ends might try to pull the spool 'out of plane' or tilt it. This tilting motion against the applied force could also cost energy or create geometrical constraints. So, I see at least two potential sources of resistance during the unwrapping process: the energy required to bend the DNA as it unspools and the geometrical penalties or energy changes associated with reorienting the spool during detachment.\n</think>\nBeyond the direct energy binding the DNA to the spool, the physical process of unwrapping under tension likely encounters resistance from the mechanical properties and geometry involved. This could include the energy required to bend the relatively stiff DNA as it detaches and becomes part of the free segment, and potential energy changes or geometrical constraints imposed by the helical wrapping that might require the spool to tilt or reorient as a turn is released.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "How might the helical geometry and DNA stiffness combine with applied tension to create a kinetic barrier that leads to sudden unwrapping?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<think>\nOkay, imagine the DNA is wrapped. The applied force is pulling on the ends. As the DNA tries to unwrap, it has to navigate the helical path geometry. This path isn't necessarily aligned perfectly with the direction of the pulling force at all points. So, the force isn't always acting optimally to peel it off. Plus, as a segment detaches, it has to bend away from the core, and the DNA's stiffness fights this bending. This combination of unfavorable force projection due to the geometry and the energy cost of bending the DNA could create a configuration where the energy *increases* slightly as you start to unwrap, even though you're applying a force. This temporary increase acts like an energy 'hill' or kinetic barrier. If the system needs to overcome this barrier to proceed with unwrapping, it might get stuck until enough force (or thermal energy) is available to cross the 'hill' all at once, leading to a sudden jump to a lower energy, more unwrapped state.\n</think>\nThe combination of the helical geometry, the DNA's bending stiffness, and the direction of the applied tension can create an energy landscape with kinetic barriers. As the DNA attempts to unspool, the force's effectiveness might be limited by the geometric path, and energy must be invested to bend the detaching DNA segment. This combined resistance can momentarily increase the system's energy during the unwrapping transition, forming an energy barrier. The system may remain trapped before this barrier until sufficient force or energy allows it to quickly transition to a more unwrapped state, resulting in sudden, rather than continuous, release.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "Could this same theoretical idea explain the quantized unwrapping seen in both small nucleosomes and much larger DNA toroids?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "<think>\nNucleosomes are protein-DNA complexes, quite small, with a specific number of DNA turns. Toroids are larger, formed by DNA condensing on itself, potentially with many turns. They seem very different. However, at a fundamental level, both are structures where DNA is wrapped in a superhelical path around a core (protein or self-assembled DNA). If the underlying principle of a kinetic barrier comes from the geometry of the wrapped helix, the stiffness of the DNA, and the way tension interacts with this structure, then maybe that principle applies regardless of the scale or what the core is made of. As long as you have DNA helically wrapped under tension, this kind of barrier mechanism might be at play, leading to sudden release events corresponding to discrete units of wrapping, like a single turn.\n</think>\nYes, if the mechanism creating the kinetic barrier is rooted in the fundamental physics of a stiff polymer (DNA) wrapped in a superhelical geometry under tension, then this principle could be universal.

I'm thinking about two main ways these factors can fluctuate: one that impacts the rate at which the tumor grows (a multiplicative effect, because its impact scales with the current size) and another that directly adds or removes cells regardless of the growth rate (an additive effect). Now, what if these two types of fluctuations aren't independent? What if the same external influence, say a therapy or environmental change, causes both types of variability? This means the multiplicative and additive noises could be correlated.\n\nMy core question is, does the *degree* to which these noises are correlated matter for the ultimate fate of the tumor? If they are strongly correlated, does it behave differently in the long run than if they are completely uncorrelated?\n\nLet's imagine the effect of fluctuations. Without correlation, the multiplicative noise might make the growth rate jump around, and the additive noise might randomly add or subtract cells. These would likely spread out the probability distribution of tumor size over time, making the future size less certain.\n\nBut if there's a strong correlation, consider what happens if a fluctuation simultaneously reduces the growth rate *and* removes cells. If this happens consistently due to the correlation, it feels like it could act as a more powerful force pushing the tumor population downwards compared to random, uncoordinated effects. Conversely, if the correlation linked increased growth rate with adding cells, it might strongly favor tumor survival and growth.\n\nSo, the nature of the correlation seems critical. A positive correlation between noise that hinders growth and noise that removes cells could mean these factors gang up on the tumor more effectively. This coordinated effect might make states of very low cell numbers, or even complete extinction (zero cells), more likely or more stable outcomes in the long term.\n\nIntuitively, uncorrelated noise just makes things fuzzier around the average. But correlated noise, depending on the sign and strength of the correlation, might introduce a systematic push or pull on the tumor population dynamics that favors one outcome (extinction) over another (persistent growth). It's not just about the *amount* of fluctuation, but how the different types of fluctuations are synchronized. This synchronization, captured by the correlation parameter, could fundamentally reshape the probability distribution of the tumor size, perhaps shifting the peak towards zero and making the distribution at higher cell numbers shrink.\n\nThis suggests that understanding this correlation is vital. It's not enough to just know the average effect of external factors or even their independent variability; their coordinated action might be the key to determining if the tumor population survives or dies out over time.\n</think>\nThe correlation between environmental fluctuations that affect tumor growth rate and those that directly impact cell numbers appears to significantly influence the long-term fate of the tumor population. A strong positive correlation between noises that negatively impact growth and those that remove cells can act as a coordinated force, making low tumor cell numbers or even complete extinction a more probable or stable long-term outcome compared to scenarios with uncorrelated fluctuations.

I can try to estimate this need, maybe by looking at projections for renewable energy penetration and scaling storage requirements seen in energy system models.\nComparing the technically available capacity in salt caverns to the estimated storage demand in different countries and regions will tell me about the ", "role": "assistant"}], "entry_type": "single-long", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "avg_thinking_tokens": 398.0, "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"}

Finding these shapes is really hard because there are so many possible ways the chain can fold. Traditional methods like standard Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics can get stuck in local minima, places that look like the lowest energy nearby, but aren't the true global minimum.\n\nWe've used a method called PERM before for simpler protein models *on a lattice*. It's a chain-growth method, which means we build the protein up monomer by monomer. At each step, we explore possible next positions, estimate their \"weight\" (which relates to how likely they are to be part of a low-energy chain, incorporating energy terms and a bias to correct for the sequential sampling), and then we use \"population control\". Chains that seem promising (high weight) are copied, and chains that seem unlikely to lead to a low energy state (low weight) are discarded. This balances exploration and exploitation.\n\nNow, moving to an *off-lattice* model is a big step. On a lattice, the possible next steps are discrete \u2013 just the allowed directions on the grid. In a continuous space, there are infinitely many possible positions for the next monomer, constrained only by the fixed bond length to the previous one. How do we handle that with PERM? We can't explore *all* possibilities. The text mentions choosing a finite, random set of \"candidate locations\" for the next monomer at each step. This seems like a critical adaptation. How many candidates do we need? Too few, and we might miss good folding pathways; too many, and the computation explodes. We need to figure out an optimal number, maybe testing different values. The text suggests a relatively high number like 50 might be necessary, unlike the few candidates on a lattice.\n\nAnother thing is the interactions. On a lattice, interactions are only between nearest neighbors on the grid, which simplifies things. Here, it's a Lennard-Jones-like potential between *all* non-consecutive monomers, and there's also an angle energy term. The weight calculation in PERM needs to correctly incorporate these more complex, distance-dependent energies at each step of chain growth. This feels like it could be computationally much more expensive than on a lattice, especially for longer chains.\n\nThe text also talks about a \"new\" version of PERM (nPERM) with a specific branching strategy. In the old PERM, when a chain got a high weight, we'd just make exact copies. But then these copies might just follow the exact same path, reducing the diversity of conformations explored. The new version forces the copies to immediately diverge by choosing different *last monomer* positions from the set of candidates. This seems like a really clever way to maintain diversity. Instead of just cloning, we're actively exploring slightly different continuations from promising points. This could be key to avoiding getting stuck in the basins of attraction of poor local minima and actually finding lower energy states. We'll need to decide how many diverging branches (\"siblings\") to allow from a single promising chain, balancing diversity with computational cost. The text hints that a small number, like up to 3, might be effective.\n\nFinally, PERM is a sampling method. It helps find *likely* low-energy regions in the vast conformational space. But the true minimum energy state is a specific point in that continuous space. The text confirms what seems intuitive: PERM gets us *close*, and then we need a deterministic method like conjugate gradient descent to slide down into the nearest energy minimum. The quality of the final result depends entirely on how close PERM gets to the *global* minimum's basin of attraction. If PERM consistently lands in deeper basins than other methods, even if they are only local minima, then this approach could potentially find lower energy states than previously found.\n\nSo, adapting PERM requires careful consideration of the candidate selection in continuous space, efficiently incorporating the complex off-lattice potentials into the weights, and leveraging that new diversity-enhancing branching strategy. Success will mean showing that this off-lattice nPERM can consistently find configurations with energies as low as, or ideally lower than, the best found by other methods for this AB model benchmark.\n</think>\nAdapting a lattice-based chain growth method like PERM to an off-lattice protein model involves crucial adjustments, primarily in how possible next steps are selected in the continuous space. Instead of predefined lattice directions, a set of random candidate locations for the next monomer must be sampled, and selecting an appropriate number of these candidates is vital for efficiently exploring conformations. The method must also accurately incorporate the more complex, distance-dependent interactions and angle energies into the weight calculation at each growth step. A key strategy for improving performance and avoiding getting trapped in local minima is employing a population control technique that not only clones promising chains but also forces immediate divergence in the structure of the clones to maintain exploration diversity. The method is expected to find configurations close to low-energy states, requiring a subsequent deterministic minimization step to reach the exact energy minimum.", "role": "assistant"}], "entry_type": "single-long", "categories": ["cond-mat.stat-mech", "cond-mat.soft", "q-bio"], "avg_thinking_tokens": 904.0, "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"}
