Chaotic systems are prevalent throughout the world today: in weather patterns, disease outbreaks, and even financial markets. Chaotic systems are seen in every field of science and humanities, so being able to predict these systems is greatly beneficial to society. In this study, we evaluate 10 different machine learning models and neural networks [1] based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 values for their ability to predict one of these systems, the multi-pendulum. We begin by generating synthetic data representing the angles of the pendulum over time using the Runge Kutta Method for solving 4th Order Differential Equations (ODE-RK4) [2]. At first, we used the single-step sliding window approach, predicting the 50st step after training for steps 0-49 and so forth. However, to more accurately cover chaotic motion and behavior in these systems, we transitioned to a time-step based approach. Here, we trained the model/network on many initial angles and tested it on a completely new set of initial angles, or 'in-between' to capture chaotic motion to its fullest extent. We also evaluated the stability of the system using Lyapunov exponents. We concluded that for a double pendulum, the best model was the Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)[3] for the sliding window and time step approaches in both friction and frictionless scenarios. For triple pendulum, the Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)[4] was the best for the sliding window and Gated Recurrent Network (GRU) [5] was the best for the time step approach, but for friction, LSTM was the best.", "categories": ["cs.LG", "nlin.CD"], "primary_category": "cs.LG", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13453v1", "doi": null}

Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the primary dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing nonlinear dynamics, offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content, and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters are studied in two illustrative examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire system (AdEx). It is shown that the denoising performance improves via truncating redundant nodes and edges of the computing reservoir, as well as properly optimizing the hyperparameters, e.g., the leakage rate, the spectral radius, the input connectivity, and the ridge regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen attractors from the bifurcation diagram.

In this context, the chaotic tipping window was recently introduced and investigated for discrete-time dynamics. In this paper, we find tipping windows for continuous-time nonlinear systems forced by chaos. We characterise the tipping window in terms of forcing by unstable periodic orbits of the chaos, and we show how the location and structure of this window depend on the relative timescales between the forcing and the responding system. We illustrate this by finding tipping windows for two examples of coupled bistable ODEs forced with chaos.

Using Bayesian methods to fit a seasonally forced transmission model to long-term surveillance data from Denmark (1958-1995, 2010-2025), we investigate the mechanisms driving recurrent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae. The period of the multiannual cycles (predominantly approx. 5 years in Denmark) are explained as a consequence of the interaction of two time-scales in the system, one intrinsic and one extrinsic (seasonal). While it provides an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), we find that the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, failing to reproduce the observed 4-5-year periodicity long-term. Upon further analysis, the system is found to exhibit transient chaos and thus high sensitivity to stochasticity. We show that environmental (but not purely demographic) stochasticity can sustain the multi-year cycles via stochastic resonance. The disruptive effects of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on M. pneumoniae circulation constitute a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations of deterministic epidemic models for long-term prediction.

It is shown here that all characteristic features of the FPUT paradox are rendered even more striking if short(er) wavelength modes are evolved instead. Since not every normal mode leads to equipartition, we also provide a simple technique to predict which modes, and in what order, are excited starting from an initial mode (root) in $\\alpha$-FPUT chains. The excitation sequences associated with a root are then shown to spread energy at different speeds, leading to prethermalization regimes that become longer as a function of mode excitation number.

The performance of adaptable RC is evaluated in various contexts, and it is found that the sustaining period is influenced by multiple factors, including the size of the training dataset, the overall coupling strength of the system, and the number of substituted oscillators.

Of late, there is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the environment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are influenced by the changing environment. However, in real life, the information about the true environmental state must pass through some noisy channel (like usually imperfect sensory apparatus of the players) before it is perceived by the players: The players naturally are prone to sometimes perceive the true state erroneously. Given the uncertain perceived environment, the players may adopt bet-hedging kind of strategies in which they play different actions in different perceptions. In a population of such ill-informed players, a player would be confused about the information state of her opponent, and an incomplete information situation akin to a Bayesian game surfaces. In short, we contemplate possibility of natural emergence of symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of Bayesian games and eco-evolutionary games when the players are equipped with inefficient sensory apparatus. Herein, we illustrate this connection using a setup of infinitely large, well-mixed population of players equipped with two actions for exploiting a resource (the environment) at two different rates so that the resource state evolves accordingly.

Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, our models exhibit robustness to noise in training data and remain effective even when prior coupling knowledge is imperfect.

Recently, the focus has shifted towards stochastic models, quantifying fixation probabilities and analysing systems with constants of motion. Yet, the role of stochastic effects in systems with chaotic dynamics remains largely unexplored within evolutionary game theory. This study addresses how demographic noise -- arising from probabilistic birth and death events -- impacts chaotic dynamics in finite populations. We show that despite stochasticity, large populations retain a signature of chaotic dynamics, as evidenced by comparing a chaotic deterministic system with its stochastic counterpart. More concretely, the strange attractor observed in the deterministic model is qualitatively recovered in the stochastic model, where the term deterministic chaos loses its meaning. We employ tools from nonlinear dynamics to quantify how the population size influences the dynamics. We observe that for small populations, stochasticity dominates, overshadowing deterministic selection effects. However, as population size increases, the dynamics increasingly reflect the underlying chaotic structure. This resilience to demographic noise can be essential for maintaining diversity in populations, even in non-equilibrium dynamics.

A discrete Koopman operator is used to evolve convolutional coordinates that govern the temporal dynamics of spectral orthogonal modes, which in turn represent the energetically most salient large-scale coherent flow structures.

Its most promising theoretical descriptions are likely to emerge from non-perturbative approaches, with symmetry-based methods being particularly reliable. One such symmetry-based framework is supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS). STS reformulates a general form stochastic (partial) differential equations (SDE) as a cohomological topological field theory (TFT) and identifies the order associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the corresponding topological supersymmetry (TS) as the stochastic generalization of chaos. The Faddeev-Popov ghosts of STS act as a systematic bookkeeping tool for the dynamic differentials from the definition of the butterfly effect (BE): the infinitely long dynamical memory unique to chaos. Accordingly, the effective field theory (EFT) of the TS breaking is essentially a field theory of the BE in the long-wavelength limit. Building on this perspective, here we demonstrate that one way to build such EFTs is the background field method with the external $\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ supergauge field coupled to N=2 supercurrents of STS, the fermion number conservation, and translations in time. By the Goldstone theorem, the resulting EFTs are conformal field theories (CFTs) and the operator product expansion provides an explanation for 1/f noise -- the experimental signature of chaos in the form of dynamical power-law correlations. Moreover, the generating functional of the background field possesses its own TS, revealing the topological nature of the BE. Particularly, when the Anti-de Sitter(AdS)/CFT correspondence is an acceptable approximation, the holographic dual of EFT is a cohomological TFT on AdS in which the associated TS and the isometry of the basespace underlie the BE and 1/f noise, respectively.", "categories": ["hep-th", "math-ph", "math.MP", "nlin.CD", "37A50, 60G05, 57R56"], "primary_category": "hep-th", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18124v1", "doi": null}

Here, we derive the universal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field, at Debye and sub-Debye scales, for a turbulent Vlasov-Poisson plasma. This spectrum arises from what is likely to be the final cascade - a universal regime to be encountered at the extreme small-scale end of any turbulent cascade in a nearly collisionless plasma. The cascaded invariant is $C_2$, the quadratic Casimir invariant of the particle distribution function. $C_2$ cascades to small scales in position and velocity space via linear and nonlinear phase mixing, in such a way that the time scales of the two processes are critically balanced at every scale. We construct a scaling theory of the fluctuation spectrum of $C_2$ and of the electric field in wavenumber space. The electric-field spectrum is sufficiently steep for the nonlinear mixing to be controlled by the largest-scale electric fields, and so the $C_2$ cascade resembles the Batchelor cascade of a passive scalar. Our theory is supported by simulations of a forced 1D-1V plasma. We predict that the cascade is terminated at the wavenumber where the turbulent electric-field spectrum gives way to the thermal noise spectrum. The time scale for this small-scale cutoff to be reached is the dynamical time of phase-space mixing times a logarithmic factor in the plasma parameter - this is the first concrete demonstration of this property of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence, akin to how fluid turbulence dissipates energy at a rate independent (or nearly independent) of molecular diffusion.

Using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method, we efficiently quantify chaos, compare the behavior of magnetic field lines and particle orbits, visualize the radial distribution of chaotic regions, and offer GALI as a valuable tool for studying plasma physics dynamics. We also study the evolution of phase space structures in a 3D barred galactic potential, following successive 2D and 3D pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations of periodic orbits.

Among the low-hanging fruits of this new perspective, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), are theoretical explanations of 1/f noise and self-organized criticality. Central to STS is the physical meaning of TS breaking order parameter (OP). In this paper, we discuss that the OP is a field-theoretic embodiment of the 'butterfly effect' (BE) -- the infinitely long dynamical memory that is definitive of chaos. We stress that the formulation of the corresponding effective theory for the OP would mark the inception of the first consistent physical theory of the BE.

We demonstrate an alternative technique to classical trajectory Monte Carlo computations, based on classical periodic orbit theory. In this technique, escape rates are computed from a relatively modest number (a few thousand) of periodic orbits of the system. One only needs the orbits' periods and stability eigenvalues. A major advantage of this approach is that one does not need to repeat the entire analysis from scratch as system parameters are varied; one can numerically continue the periodic orbits instead.

We find that the distribution of first return times satisfies a simple scaling form. In turn, the transmission coefficient, defined as the fraction of trajectories that starting at the cell at the origin escape the channel through the other boundary, decays algebraically with the size of the system, and, as a signature of non-recurrent transport, sometimes slower. From these two processes we derive a locking relation among the scaling exponents for the asymptotic behavior of the MSD, the times of first return to the origin and the way transmission decays with the system size, showing that these three processes are interdependent.

These systems exhibit positive Lyapunov exponents, which significantly hinder accurate long-term forecasting. As a result, understanding long-term statistical behavior is far more valuable than focusing on short-term accuracy. While autoregressive deep sequence models have been applied to capture long-term behavior, they often lead to exponentially increasing errors in learned dynamics. To address this, we shift the focus from simple prediction errors to preserving an invariant measure in dissipative chaotic systems. These systems have attractors, where trajectories settle, and the invariant measure is the probability distribution on attractors that remains unchanged under dynamics. Existing methods generate long trajectories of dissipative chaotic systems by aligning invariant measures, but it is not always possible to obtain invariant measures for arbitrary datasets. We propose the Poincare Flow Neural Network (PFNN), a novel operator learning framework designed to capture behaviors of chaotic systems without any explicit knowledge of the invariant measure. PFNN employs an auto-encoder to map the chaotic system to a finite-dimensional feature space, effectively linearizing the chaotic evolution. It then learns the linear evolution operators to match the physical dynamics by addressing two critical properties in dissipative chaotic systems: (1) contraction, the system's convergence toward its attractors, and (2) measure invariance, trajectories on the attractors following a probability distribution invariant to the dynamics.

In coupled oscillator systems, identifying the type of interaction (e.g. pairwise or three-body) of a network is challenging, because different interactions can induce similar dynamical states and bifurcations. In this study, we have developed a method based on the adaptive LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) to infer the interactions between the oscillators from time series data. The proposed method can successfully classify the type of interaction and infer the probabilities of the existence of pairwise and three-body couplings. Through systematic analysis of synthetic datasets, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms two baseline methods, LASSO and OLS (Ordinary Least Squares), in accurately inferring the topology and strength of couplings between oscillators.

This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\\% of the time.

However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits.

A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\\'{e}nard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization.

Specifically, we obtain the so-called Zakharov equation for $4$-wave resonant interactions and its extension to $5$-wave resonant interactions by Krasitskii, but we introduce an important new feature: even the generic terms in these normal forms contain $resonant$ $interactions$ $only$, via a $unique$ canonical transformation. The resulting normal forms provide an approximation to the original FPUT lattice that possesses a significant number of exact quadratic conservation laws, beyond the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian. We call the new equations \"exact-resonance evolution equations\" and examine their properties: (i) Heisenberg representation's slow evolution allows us to implement numerical methods with large time steps to obtain relevant dynamical information, such as Lyapunov exponents. (ii) We introduce tests, such as convergence of the normal form transformation and truncation error verification, to successfully validate our exact-resonance evolution equations. (iii) The systematic construction of new quadratic invariants (via the resonant cluster matrix) allows us to use finite-time Lyapunov exponent calculations to quantify the level of nonlinearity at which the original FPUT lattice is well approximated by the exact-resonance evolution equations. We show numerical experiments in the case $N=9$, but the theory and numerical methods are valid for arbitrary values of $N$.

The algorithm, dubbed Pontryagin-Bellman Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP), is the result of the incorporation of Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) into the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) formulation. Unlike traditional indirect methods that rely on first-order shooting techniques to determine the optimal costate, PDDP optimizes the costates using a null-space trust-region method, solving a series of quadratic subproblems derived from first- and second-order sensitivities. Terminal equality constraints are handled via a general augmented Lagrangian method, while state-path constraints are enforced using a quadratic penalty approach. The resulting solution method represents a significant improvement over classical indirect methods, which are known to be ineffective for state-constrained problems. The use of DDP to optimize the costate partially reduces the inherent sensitivities of indirect methods, thereby improving the robustness to poor initial guess. Finally, the incorporation of PMP within the DDP formulation enables the design of long-duration, multi-spiral low-thrust trajectories with fewer optimization variables compared to classical DDP formulations.

The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "nlin.CD", "physics.soc-ph"], "primary_category": "q-bio.PE", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19063v2", "doi": null}

Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes.

To address this problem, this article proposes a pioneering CE quantification framework for Gaussian iterative systems (GIS), based on approximate dynamical reversibility derived from SVD of covariance matrices in forward and backward dynamics.

Their simplicity lies in the use of a finite set of states and a uniform local rule, yet this simplicity leads to rich and diverse dynamical behaviors. CCAs have found applications in numerous scientific fields, including quantum computing, biology, social sciences, and cryptography. However, traditional CCAs assume complete certainty in the state of all cells, which limits their ability to model systems with inherent uncertainty. This paper introduces a novel generalization of CCAs, termed Cellular Automata on Measures (CAMs), which extends the classical framework to incorporate probabilistic uncertainty. In this setting, the state of each cell is described by a probability measure, and the local rule operates on configurations of such measures. This generalization encompasses the traditional Bernoulli measure framework of CCAs and enables the study of more complex systems, including those with spatially varying probabilities.

Model II restricts individual transactions to agents within the same group, but allows for collective transactions between groups. A three-step trading process--comprising intergroup transactions, intragroup redistribution, and individual exchanges--is developed to capture the dual-layered market dynamics. The saving propensity is incorporated using the Chakraborti-Chakrabarti model, applied to both individual and collective transactions. Results reveal that collective transactions increase wealth inequality by concentrating wealth within groups, as indicated by higher Gini coefficients and Kolkata indices. In contrast, individual transactions across groups mitigate inequality through more uniform wealth redistribution. The interplay between saving propensities and collective transactions governs deviation degree and entropy, which display inverse trends. Higher saving propensities lead to deviations from the Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium, whereas specific thresholds result in collective transaction dominance, producing notable peaks or troughs in these metrics.

Traffic congestion on expressways is a severe issue. To alleviate its negative impacts, it is necessary to optimize traffic flow prior to becoming serious congestion. For this purpose, real-time short-term traffic flow prediction is promising. However, conventional traffic monitoring apparatus used in prediction methods faces a technical issue due to the sparsity in traffic flow data. To overcome the issue for realizing real-time traffic prediction, this paper employs DFOS, which enables to obtain spatially continuous and real-time traffic flow data along the road without dead zones. Using mean velocities derived from DFOS data as a feature extraction, this paper proposes a real-time data assimilation method for the short-term prediction. As the theoretical model, the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model is adopted. Future traffic flow is simulated with the optimal values of model parameters estimated from observed mean velocities and the initial condition estimated as the latest microscopic traffic state. This concept is validated using two congestion scenarios obtained in Japanese expressways. The results show that the mean absolute error of the predicted mean velocities is 10-15 km/h in the prediction horizon of 30 minutes. Furthermore, the prediction error in congestion length and travel time decreases by 40-84% depending on congestion scenarios when compared with conventional methods with traffic counters.

Second, we sketch several models all of which are biologically motivated extensions of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP); some of these models represent the traffic of molecular machines, like RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosome, that catalyze template-directed polymerization of RNA and proteins, respectively, whereas few other models capture the key features of the traffic of ants on trails. More specifically, using the ASEP-based models we demonstrate the effects of traffic of RNAPs and ribosomes on random and `programmed' errors in gene expression as well as on some other subcellular processes. We recall a puzzling empirical result on the single-lane traffic of predatory ants {\\it Leptogenys processionalis} as well as recent attempts to account for this puzzle.

Boolean networks model phenotypes as attractors, which are closely linked to minimal trap spaces (inescapable hypercubes in the system's state space). In biological applications, attractors and minimal trap spaces are typically in one-to-one correspondence. However, this correspondence is not guaranteed: motif-avoidant attractors (MAAs) that lie outside minimal trap spaces are possible.   MAAs are rare and (despite recent efforts) poorly understood. Here we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding MAAs and present several novel observations regarding their response to node deletion reductions and linear extensions of edges. We conduct large-scale computational studies on an ensemble of 14,000 models derived from published Boolean models of biological systems, and more than 100 million Random Boolean Networks. Our findings quantify the rarity of MAAs (in particular, we found no MAAs in the biological models), but highlight the role of network reduction in introducing MAAs into the dynamics.

Many papers have been published exploring the dynamics of ESCGs where competitive inter-species predator/prey relationships are modelled via the cyclic game Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) for three species, or Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) for five. At the core of these simulations is the \"Elementary Step\" (ES), in which one or two agents are chosen at random to either compete to the death, or to reproduce, or to move location. ESCG studies typically involve executing trillions of ESs and hence the computational efficiency of the core ES algorithm is a key concern. In this paper I demonstrate that the de facto standard \"Original ES\" (OES) algorithm is computationally inefficient both in time and in space due to the implicit execution of many \"no-op\" commands (i.e., commands that do nothing) and because at steady state large numbers of cells can be empty, and yet empty cells serve no purpose. I present a new \"Revised ES\" (RES) algorithm which eliminates these inefficiencies, and I show empirically that ESCGs with RES exhibit qualitatively the same characteristics as those with OES, and are also markedly more stable. The more stable dynamics of RES-based simulations means that they can be run with smaller lattices than when using OES, leading to reductions in total simulation times of 85% or more.

A resolution of these tensions triggers an evolutionary transition which expands the problem-space, at the cost of generating new tensions in the expanded space, in a continual process.

Nevertheless, a unitary time-evolution of wave functions can be realized for suitable systems, in particular probabilistic automata. Based on these insights we discuss novel aspects for correlated computing not requiring the extreme isolation of quantum computers.

Working with efficient PDE models is of high interest for parameter estimation algorithms that typically require a large number of forward model simulations. Quantitative data from cell biology experiments usually involves non-negative cell counts in different regions of the experimental images, and it is not obvious how to relate finite, noisy count data to the solutions of continuous PDE models that correspond to noise-free density profiles.

Traffic congestion is a dominant issue in highways. To reduce congestion, real-time traffic control by short-term forecast is necessary. For achieving this, data assimilation using a stochastic CA model and DFOS is promising. Data assimilation with a CA enables us to model real-time traffic flow with simple processes even when rare or sudden events occur, which is challenging for usual machine learning-based methods. DFOS overcomes issues of conventional point sensors that have dead zones of observation. By estimating optimal model parameters that reproduce observed traffic flow in the simulation, future traffic flow is forecasted from the simulation. We propose an optimal model parameter estimation method using mean velocity as an extracted feature and the particle filter. In addition, an estimation methodology for the microscopic traffic situation is developed to set the initial condition of simulation for forecast in accordance with observation. The proposed methods are verified by simulation-based traffic flow. The simulation adopts the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model. The optimal model parameters are successfully derived from posterior probability distributions (PPDs) estimated from DFOS data. In contrast, those estimated from point sensors fail. The PPDs of model parameters also indicate that each parameter has different sensitivities to traffic flow. A traffic forecast up to 60 minutes later is carried out. Using optimal model parameters estimated from DFOS, the forecast error of mean velocity is approximately $\\pm$10 km/h (percentage error is 18%).

A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which describes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual cell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many physiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of contact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance of cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is still debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as numerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell ensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact inhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a minimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by extending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells during growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous in-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a systematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell dynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of emergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective cell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the transition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent regime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the volume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only inter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a size-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed contact inhibition.", "categories": ["q-bio.CB", "nlin.CG", "physics.bio-ph", "physics.data-an", "q-bio.TO"], "primary_category": "q-bio.CB", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07612v2", "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2024.111882"}

By contrast, although computable, the bipartite mutual information (MI) is almost never explored in classical many particle systems; this owes in part to the fact that computing the MI requires keeping track of the evolution of the full probability distribution, a feat which is rarely done (or thought to be needed) in classical many-body simulations. Here, we utilize the MI to analyze the spreading of information in 1D elementary cellular automata (CA). Broadly speaking, we find that the behavior of the MI in these dynamical systems exhibits a few different types of scaling that roughly correspond to known CA universality classes.

This \"emergent\" organization has been found in a variety of natural and artificial systems, although at present the field lacks a unified understanding of what the consequences of higher-order synergies and redundancies are for systems. Typical research treat the presence (or absence) of synergistic information as a dependent variable and report changes in the level of synergy in response to some change in the system. Here, we attempt to flip the script: rather than treating higher-order information as a dependent variable, we use evolutionary optimization to evolve boolean networks with significant higher-order redundancies, synergies, or statistical complexity. We then analyse these evolved populations of networks using established tools for characterizing discrete dynamics: the number of attractors, average transient length, and Derrida coefficient. We also assess the capacity of the systems to integrate information. We find that high-synergy systems are unstable and chaotic, but with a high capacity to integrate information. In contrast, evolved redundant systems are extremely stable, but have negligible capacity to integrate information. Finally, the complex systems that balance integration and segregation (known as Tononi-Sporns-Edelman complexity) show features of both chaosticity and stability, with a greater capacity to integrate information than the redundant systems while being more stable than the random and synergistic systems. We conclude that there may be a fundamental trade-off between the robustness of a systems dynamics and its capacity to integrate information (which inherently requires flexibility and sensitivity), and that certain kinds of complexity naturally balance this trade-off.", "categories": ["cs.IT", "math.DS", "math.IT", "nlin.CD", "nlin.CG"], "primary_category": "cs.IT", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14347v2", "doi": null}

We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time.

Our framework for an open-ended system includes two components: a complex system used to recursively grow and complexify artifacts over time, and a discovery algorithm that leverages the concept of meta-diversity search. Since complex systems have shown to enable the emergence of considerable complexity from set of simple rules, we believe them to be great candidates to generate all sort of artifacts in Minecraft. Yet, the space of possible artifacts that can be generated by these systems is often unknown, challenging to characterize and explore. Therefore automating the long-term discovery of novel and increasingly complex artifacts in these systems is an exciting research field. To approach these challenges, we formulate the problem of meta-diversity search where an artificial \"discovery assistant\" incrementally learns a diverse set of representations to characterize behaviors and searches to discover diverse patterns within each of them. A successful discovery assistant should continuously seek for novel sources of diversities while being able to quickly specialize the search toward a new unknown type of diversity. To implement those ideas in the Minecraft environment, we simulate an artificial \"chemistry\" system based on Lenia continuous cellular automaton for generating artifacts, as well as an artificial \"discovery assistant\" (called Holmes) for the artifact-discovery process.

This makes the use of automatic calibration algorithms hard to apply due to the large number of model runs. However, with the recent advances in parallel processing, computational resources, and increasing high-resolution climatologic and GIS data, high-resolution hydrodynamic models can be used for optimization-based calibration. This paper presents a global optimization-based algorithm to calibrate a fully distributed hydrologic-hydrodynamic and water quality model (HydroPol2D) using observed data (i.e., discharge, or pollutant concentration) as input. The algorithm can find a near-optimal set of parameters to explain observed gauged data. The modeling framework presented here, although applied in a poorly-gauged catchment, can be adapted for catchments with more detailed observations. We applied the algorithm in different cases of the V-Tilted Catchment, the Wooden-Board catchment, and in an existing urban catchment with heterogeneous data. The results of automatic calibration indicate $\\mathrm{NSE} = 0.99$ for the V-Tilted catchment, $\\mathrm{RMSE} = 830~\\mathrm{mgL^{-1}}$ for salt concentration pollutographs (i.e., 8.3% of the event mean concentration), and $\\mathrm{NSE} = 0.89$ for the urban catchment case study.

In LCA, each cell's next state is determined by the interaction of two layers of computation, allowing for more dynamic and realistic simulations. This thesis explores the design, dynamics, and applications of LCA, with a focus on its potential in pattern recognition and classification. The research begins by introducing the limitations of traditional CA in capturing the complexity of real-world systems. It then presents the concept of LCA, where layer 0 corresponds to a predefined model, and layer 1 represents the proposed model with additional influence. The interlayer rules, denoted as f and g, enable interactions not only from adjacent neighboring cells but also from some far-away neighboring cells, capturing long-range dependencies. The thesis explores various LCA models, including those based on averaging, maximization, minimization, and modified ECA neighborhoods. Additionally, the implementation of LCA on the 2-D cellular automaton Game of Life is discussed, showcasing intriguing patterns and behaviors. Through extensive experiments, the dynamics of different LCA models are analyzed, revealing their sensitivity to rule changes and block size variations. Convergent LCAs, which converge to fixed points from any initial configuration, are identified and used to design a two-class pattern classifier. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the competitive performance of the LCA-based classifier against existing algorithms.

Discrete time crystals exhibit rigid subharmonic oscillations, which result from a combination of many-body interactions, collective synchronization, and ergodicity breaking. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in the study of quantum and classical discrete time crystals. We focus on the breaking of ergodicity as the key to discrete time crystals and the delaying of ergodicity as the source of numerous phenomena that share many of the properties of discrete time crystals, including the AC Josephson effect, coupled map lattices, and Faraday waves. Theoretically, there exists a diverse array of strategies to stabilize time crystalline order in both closed and open systems, ranging from localization and prethermalization to dissipation and error correction. Experimentally, many-body quantum simulators provide a natural platform for investigating signatures of time crystalline order; recent work utilizing trapped ions, solid-state spin systems, and superconducting qubits will be reviewed. Finally, this Colloquium concludes by describing outstanding challenges in the field and a vision for new directions on both the experimental and theoretical fronts.", "categories": ["quant-ph", "cond-mat.dis-nn", "cond-mat.quant-gas", "cond-mat.str-el", "nlin.CG"], "primary_category": "quant-ph", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08904v1", "doi": "10.1103/RevModPhys.95.031001"}

We focused on small complex networks with node degrees ranging from zero to a maximum of approximately 20 to study agent behavior in traffic and transportation networks. We measured the hunting rate, that is, the rate of change of agent amounts in each node per unit of time, and the imbalance of agent distribution among nodes. Our simulation study reveals that the topological structure of a network precisely determines agent distribution when agents perform full random walks; however, their destination selections alter the agent distribution. Notably, rule (c) makes hunting and imbalance rates significantly high compared with random walk cases (a) and (b), irrespective of network types, when the network has a high degree and high activity rate. Compared with the full random walk in (a), (b) increases the hunting rate while decreasing the imbalance rate when activity is low; however, both increase when activity is high. These characteristics exhibit slight periodic undulations over time. Furthermore, our analysis shows that in the BA, ER, and WS network models, the hunting rate decreases and the imbalance rate increases when the system disconnects randomly selected nodes in simulations where agents follow rules (a)-(c) and the network has the ability to disconnect nodes within a certain time of all time steps.

Polluted stormwater runoff may be sources of water supply. Modeling the quantity and quality dynamics of stormwater runoff requires a coupled hydrodynamic module capable of estimating the transport and fate of pollutants. In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of a distributed hydrodynamic model coupled with a water quality model (HydroPol2D). First, the model is compared to GSSHA and WCA2D in the V-Tilted catchment, and the limitation of the critical velocity of WCA2D is investigated. We also applied the model in a laboratory wooden board catchment, focusing on the validation of the numerical approach to simulate water quality dynamics.

Semantic information is defined as the subset of correlations, measured via the transfer entropy, between agent $A$ and environment $E$ that is necessary for the agent to maintain its viability $V$. Viability, in turn, is endogenously defined as opposed to the use of exogenous quantities like utility functions. In our model, the forager's movements are determined by its ability to measure, via a sensor, the presence of an individual unit of resource, while the viability function is its expected lifetime. Through counterfactual interventions -- scrambling the correlations between agent and environment via noising the sensor -- we demonstrate the presence of a critical value of the noise parameter, $\\eta_c$, above which the forager's expected lifetime is dramatically reduced. On the other hand, for $\\eta < \\eta_c$ there is little-to-no effect on its ability to survive. We refer to this boundary as the semantic threshold, quantifying the subset of agent-environment correlations that the agent actually needs to maintain its desired state of staying alive. Each bit of information affects the agent's ability to persist both above and below the semantic threshold. Modeling the viability curve and its semantic threshold via forager/environment parameters, we show how the correlations are instantiated.

The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation.

In this formulation, the linear coupling become diagonalizable, whereas all cubic nonlinear terms transform into a combinatorial sum over a product of three modal amplitudes weighted by a fourth-order mixing tensor. We have identified the exact structure of several mixing tensors (corresponding to different types of cubic nonlinearities) and tied their symmetry properties (quasi-Hermiticity and permutation symmetries associated with two lattice conservation laws) with thermalization or lack thereof. Furthermore, we have observed through direct numerical simulations that the modal occupancies of lattices preserving these tensorial symmetries approach a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution at thermal equilibrium. In addition, we provided few examples that indicate that cubic lattices with broken tensorial symmetries end up not to equilibrate to a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution. Finally, an inverse approach to the study of thermalization of cubic nonlinear lattices is developed. It establishes a duality property between lattices in local and modal bases. The idea is to establish a trade-off between the type of nonlinearities in local base and their respective interactions in supermode base. With this at hand, we were able to identify a large class of nonlinear lattices that are embedded in the modal space and admit a simple form that can be used to shed more light on the role that localization (or delocalization) of the supermodes play in thermalization processes.", "categories": ["nlin.PS", "78A60"], "primary_category": "nlin.PS", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00871v1", "doi": null}

A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, the demonstrated structures are relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the previously unknown coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of top-down nanofabrication techniques.", "categories": ["physics.optics", "cond-mat.mtrl-sci", "nlin.AO", "nlin.PS"], "primary_category": "physics.optics", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23474v1", "doi": null}

Here we show that tissue-scale spatial structure can have a profound impact on the resilience of tumours to immunotherapy using a classical model incorporating IL-2 compounds and effector cells as treatment parameters. Using linear stability analysis, numerical continuation, and direct simulations, we show that diffusing cancer cell populations can undergo pattern-forming (Turing) instabilities, leading to spatially-structured states that persist far into treatment regimes where the corresponding spatially homogeneous systems would uniformly predict a cancer-free state. These spatially-patterned states persist in a wide range of parameters, as well as under time-dependent treatment regimes. Incorporating treatment via domain boundaries can increase this resistance to treatment in the interior of the domain, further highlighting the importance of spatial modelling when designing treatment protocols informed by mathematical models. Counter-intuitively, this mechanism shows that increased effector cell mobility can increase the resilience of tumours to treatment.

While the interaction of fundamental solitons was studied early on, no results are presently available for other types of soliton-breather and breather-breather interactions. Our study reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental breather. Conversely, the interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental breathers with polarization shifts, but may also result in a fundamental soliton and a fundamental breather. Composite breathers interact trivially both with each other and with a fundamental soliton or breather.

Specifically, linear data-driven models have struggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that explore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these nonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on the recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is applicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay at a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its intended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds (aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot.

In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of material particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched elastic surface surrounding the body.

Such HOTI can support linear topological corner states that give rise to rich families of quadratic topological solitons bifurcating from linear corner states. The presence of phase mismatch between parametrically interacting fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves drastically affects the bifurcation scenarios and domains of soliton existence, making the families of corner solitons much richer in comparison with those in HOTIs with cubic nonlinearity. For instance, the internal soliton structure strongly depends on the location of propagation constant in forbidden gaps in spectra of both FF and SH waves. Two different types of corner solitons are obtained, where either FF or SH wave dominates in the bifurcation point from linear corner state. Because the waveguides are two-mode for SH wave, its spectrum features two groups of forbidden gaps with corner states of different symmetry appearing in each of them.

Such a social dilemma can be further complicated by the role played by space for both resources and harvesters, where spatial diffusion of resources and directed motion of harvesters can potentially feature the emergence of clusters of environmental resource and sustainable harvesting strategies. In this paper, we explore a PDE model of evolutionary game theory with environmental feedback, describing how the spatial distribution of resource extraction strategies and environmental resources can change due to both local eco-evolutionary dynamics and environmental-driven directed motion of harvesters. Through linear stability analysis, we show that this biased motion towards higher-quality environments can lead to spatial patterns in the distribution of extraction strategies, creating local regions with improved environmental quality and increase payoff for resource extractors. However, by measuring the average payoff and environmental quality across the spatial domain, we see that this pattern-forming mechanism can actually decrease the overall success of the population relative to the equilibrium outcome in the absence of spatial motion. This suggests that environmental-driven motion can produce a spatial social dilemma, in which biased motion towards more beneficial regions can produce emergent patterns featuring a worse overall environment for the population.", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "nlin.PS", "physics.soc-ph", "92, 91"], "primary_category": "q-bio.PE", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06723v1", "doi": null}

In this paper, based on a combination of experiments, theoretical modeling, and finite element simulations, we systematically investigate the buckling and post-buckling behavior of cylindrical shells under combined torsional and axial loads. Three different types of combined loads are considered: compression with pre-torsion, torsion with pre-tension, and torsion with pre-compression. The theoretical model is established within the framework of the Donnell shell theory and solved using the Galerkin method, through which the critical buckling load, critical circumferential wavenumber, buckling pattern, and post-buckling equilibrium path of clamped-clamped thin cylindrical shells under various types of loads can be determined. The theoretical predictions agree well with finite element simulations and qualitatively capture the various buckling phenomena observed in the experiments. It is found that cylindrical shells exhibit quite different post-buckling behavior under combined loads compared to under a single compressive or torsional load. For instance, when a clamped-clamped thin cylindrical shell is subjected to pure torsion or torsion with a relatively small pre-compression, it consistently shows a diagonal-shaped pattern during deformation.

In these lecture notes we discuss the large deviation statistics of the current, a central observable out of equilibrium, using mostly macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) but also microscopic spectral methods. Special emphasis is put on describing the optimal path leading to a rare fluctuation, as well as on different dynamical symmetry breaking phenomena that appear at the fluctuating level. We start with an overview of trajectory statistics in driven diffusive systems as described by MFT. We discuss the additivity principle, a simplifying conjecture to compute the current distribution in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, and extend this idea to higher dimensions, where the nonlocal structure of the optimal current vector field becomes crucial. Next we explore dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in current fluctuations, which manifest as symmetry-breaking events in trajectory statistics. These include particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPTs in open channels, for which we work out a Landau-like theory as well as the joint statistics of the current and the order parameter. Time-translation symmetry-breaking DPTs in periodic systems are also discussed, where coherent traveling condensates emerge to facilitate current deviations. We also discuss the microscopic spectral mechanism leading to these DPTs, which is linked to an emerging degeneracy of the leading eigenspace. Using this spectral perspective, we find the signatures of the recently discovered time-crystal phases of matter in traveling-wave DPTs, and use Doob's transform to propose a packing-field mechanism to create programmable time-crystals in driven systems.

These pattern formation phenomena are important as they reflect how cellular processes such as metabolism operate in heterogeneous chemical environments. In the laboratory, they can be studied in simplified set-ups, where spatial gradients of oxygen and nutrients are externally imposed, and cells are immobilized in a gel matrix. An intriguing example, observed in such set-ups over 80 years ago, is the sequential formation of narrow bands of high cell density, taking place even for a clonal population. However, key aspects of the dynamics of band formation remained obscure. Using time-lapse imaging of replicate transparent columns in simplified growth media, we first quantify the precision of the positioning and timing of band formation. We also show that the appearance and position of different bands can be modulated independently. This \"modularity\" is suggested by the observation that different bands differ in their gene expression, and it is reproduced by a theoretical model based on the existence of internal metabolic states and the induction of a pH gradient. Finally, we can also modify the observed pattern formation by introducing genetic modifications that impair selected metabolic pathways.

The composite vortices is classified in terms of an integer pair $(S_1, S_2)$ of phase winding numbers and can share the same vortex core, while either co-rotating or counter-rotating, leading to very diverse vortex structures. We uncover different dynamical behaviors compared to results from GPE that is valid in weak coupling limit and zero temperature. In particular, we show that the occurrence of dynamic instabilities and the instability strength are sensitive to the temperature. We identify several temperature dependent dynamical transitions in $(1,1)$, $(2,\\pm 1)$ and $(2,2)$ vortices. The splitting behaviors associated with different multipolarities are demonstrated by solving the full-time evolution for slightly perturbed composite vortices.

First, general expressions are provided for the regular asymptotic approximation of the Maxwell point, which depends algebraically on the parametric distance from the codimension-two super/sub-critical Turing bifurcation. Then, expressions are derived for the width of the snaking, which is exponentially small in the same distance. The general theory is developed using a vectorised form of regular and exponential asymptotic expansions for localised patterns, which are matched at a Stokes line. Detailed calculations for a particular example are algebraically cumbersome, depend sensitively on the form of the reaction kinetics, and rely on the summation of a weakly convergent series obtained via optimal truncation. Nevertheless, the process can be automated, and code is provided that carries out the calculations automatically, only requiring the user to input the model, and the values of parameters at a codimension-two bifurcation. The general theory also applies to higher-order equations, including those that can be recast as a reaction-diffusion system.

For this, we use a flow-kick modeling framework that treats storms as instantaneous kicks to the soil water. The positive feedbacks in the storm-level hydrology, that act to concentrate water within the vegetation bands, are captured through the spatial profiles of the soil water kicks. Between storms, the soil water and vegetation, modeled by a two-component reaction-diffusion system, evolve together. We use a combination of linear stability analysis and numerical simulation to compare predictions of idealized periodic rainfall, with no variability, to predictions when there is randomness in the timing and magnitude of water input from storms. We show that including these random elements leads to a decrease in the parameter range over which patterns appear.
