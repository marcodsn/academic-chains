We use a generating functional technique to derive analytical expressions for the order parameters at the first time step ($t=1$) and the second time step ($t=2$). We find that the overlap between the target pattern and the state of the network at $t=1$ is independent of the symmetry of the additional random part of the synaptic interaction matrix. The result may have bearing on the theories which use the results at $t=1$ to estimate quantities relevant to the retrieval performance of the network. The symmetry of the synaptic interaction matrix becomes effective from the second time step, explicitly through a correlation function involving spin configurations at different times. This suggests that the prediction of the long time behavior of the network from the first few time steps may not be {\\it always} correct. This was confirmed by the numerical simulation which shows that the difference in the long time and the short time behavior of the network becomes pronounced in presence of asymmetry in the synaptic interaction matrix. It is also found in simulations that the size of the basins of attraction of the stored patterns decreases with an increase in the asymmetry. Moreover, the convergence time for the retrieval increases. These results are contrary to the expectations from the earlier studies based on the counting of fixed points. However, the convergence time for the spurious fixed points increases faster than that for the retrieval fixed points in the presence of asymmetry in the synapses.

The densities of the ions adsorbed on the phosphate strands, in the major and in the minor grooves are calculated. First, we find that the adsorption pattern on the DNA surface depends strongly on its geometrical shape: counterions adsorb preferentially along the phosphate strands for a cylindrical model shape, but in the minor groove for a geometrically structured model. Second, we find that an addition of monovalent salt ions results in an increase of the charge density in the minor groove while the total charge density of ions adsorbed in the major groove stays unchanged. The adsorbed ion densities are highly structured along the minor groove while they are almost smeared along the major groove. Furthermore, for a fixed amount of added salt, the major groove cationic charge is independent on the counterion valency. For increasing salt concentration the major groove is neutralized while the total charge adsorbed in the minor groove is constant. DNA overcharging is detected for multivalent salt.

Although object of intensive biological research, the elucidation of the main anatomic-functional purposes of the ubiquitous topographical connections in the mammals brain remains an elusive issue. The present work reports on how recent results from complex network formalism can be used to quantify and model the effect of topographical connections between neuronal cells over a number of relevant network properties such as connectivity, adjacency, and information broadcasting. While the topographical mapping between two cortical modules are achieved by connecting nearest cells from each module, three kinds of network models are adopted for implementing intracortical connections (ICC), including random, preferential-attachment, and short-range networks. It is shown that, though spatially uniform and simple, topographical connections between modules can lead to major changes in the network properties, fostering more effective intercommunication between the involved neuronal cells and modules.

However, the storage capacity of the entire network then decreases. To overcome this difficulty, we propose decreasing the connecting rate while keeping the total number of synapses constant by introducing delayed synapses. In this paper, a discrete synchronous-type model with both delayed synapses and their prunings is discussed as a concrete example of the proposal. First, we explain the Yanai-Kim theory by employing the statistical neurodynamics. This theory involves macrodynamical equations for the dynamics of a network with serial delay elements. Next, considering the translational symmetry of the explained equations, we re-derive macroscopic steady state equations of the model by using the discrete Fourier transformation. The storage capacities are analyzed quantitatively. Furthermore, two types of synaptic prunings are treated analytically: random pruning and systematic pruning. As a result, it becomes clear that in both prunings, the storage capacity increases as the length of delay increases and the connecting rate of the synapses decreases when the total number of synapses is constant. Moreover, an interesting fact becomes clear: the storage capacity asymptotically approaches $2/\\pi$ due to random pruning. In contrast, the storage capacity diverges in proportion to the logarithm of the length of delay by systematic pruning and the proportion constant is $4/\\pi$. These results theoretically support the significance of pruning following an overgrowth of synapses in the brain and strongly suggest that the brain prefers to store dynamic attractors such as sequences and limit cycles rather than equilibrium states.", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "q-bio"], "primary_category": "cond-mat.dis-nn", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305517v1", "doi": null}

Using hydrodynamic models, we examine the two mechanisms proposed by the medical community for BPPV: cupulolithiasis, in which otoconia attach directly to the cupula (a sensory membrane), and canalithiasis, in which otoconia settle through the canals and exert a fluid pressure across the cupula. We utilize known hydrodynamic calculations and make reasonable geometric and physical approximations to derive an expression for the transcupular pressure $\\Delta P_c$ exerted by a settling solid particle in canalithiasis. By tracking settling otoconia in a two-dimensional model geometry, the cupular volume displacement and associated eye response (nystagmus) can be calculated quantitatively. Several important features emerge: 1) A pressure amplification occurs as otoconia enter a narrowing duct; 2) An average-sized otoconium requires approximately five seconds to settle through the wide ampulla, where $\\Delta P_c$ is not amplified, which suggests a mechanism for the observed latency of BPPV; and 3) An average-sized otoconium beginning below the center of the cupula can cause a volumetric cupular displacement on the order of 30 pL, with nystagmus of order $2^\\circ$/s, which is approximately the threshold for sensation.

In order to study the influence of mutations, we introduce a model that mimics epidemic spreading with immunization and mutations. The model exhibits a line of continuous phase transitions and includes the general epidemic process (GEP) and directed percolation (DP) as special cases. Restricting to perfect immunization in two spatial dimensions we analyze the phase diagram and study the scaling behavior along the phase transition line as well as in the vicinity of the GEP point. We show that mutations lead generically to a crossover from the GEP to DP. Using standard scaling arguments we also predict the form of the phase transition line close to the GEP point.

We first consider a single pair of filaments, and show that when values of parameters such as the lever-arm displacement and the crossbridge elasticity are chosen to provide effective energy transduction, the T2 curve (the tension recovered immediately after a step displacement) displays a region of negative slope. If filament compliance and the discrete nature of the binding sites are taken into account, the negative slope is diminished, but not eliminated. This implies that there is an instability in the dynamics of individual half-sarcomeres. However, when the symmetric nature of whole sarcomeres is taken into account, filament rearrangement becomes important during the transient: as tension is recovered, some half-sarcomeres lengthen while others shorten. This leads to a flat T2 curve, as observed experimentally. In addition, we investigate the isotonic transient response and show that for a range of parameter values the model displays damped oscillations, as recently observed in experiments on single muscle fibers.

Here we derive expressions for the extracellular potential that include this frequency-dependent attenuation.

We analyze the effect of different radial profiles of conductivity and permittivity on the frequency-filtering behavior of this model.

In autocatalytic models, the network growth velocity is rigorously independent of the opposing force exerted by the obstacle, and the network density is proportional to the force. The dependence of the growth velocity on the branching and capping rates is evaluated by a numerical solution of the rate equations. In side-branching models, the growth velocity drops gradually to zero with decreasing branching rate, while in end-branching models the drop is abrupt.

In doing so, we understand the role of specific endogenously emerged network structures and to what extent the observed systemic risk is a result of fundamental properties of the dynamical system. We minimize systemic risk through rewiring by employing a method from statistical physics that respects firm-level constraints to production. Analyzing six specific subnetworks of the national SCNs of Ecuador and Hungary, we demonstrate that systemic risk can be considerably mitigated by 16-50% without reducing the production output of firms. A comparison of network properties before and after rewiring reveals that this risk reduction is achieved by changing the connectivity in non-trivial ways.

We build aggregate variables, such as the Business Digital Usage Score and a cyber security incidence variable to quantify each firm's digital engagement and cyber security risk. A survey-weight-adjusted Lasso estimator is employed, and a debiasing method for high-dimensional logit models is introduced to identify the drivers of technological efficiency and cyber risk. The analysis reveals a digital divide linked to firm size, industry, and workforce composition. While rapid expansion of tools such as cloud services or artificial intelligence can raise efficiency, it simultaneously heightens exposure to cyber threats, particularly among larger enterprises.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12413v1", "doi": null}

The model is formalized via a second-quantized Hamiltonian that incorporates time-dependent perturbations to represent real-world effects such as interest and profit, which drive asymmetry and systemic imbalance. This framework successfully captures both macroeconomic phenomena, including quantitative easing (QE) and gold-backed monetary regimes, and microeconomic credit creation, under a unified quantum-like formalism. In particular, QE is interpreted as generating entangled-like pairs of currency and bonds, exhibiting systemic correlations akin to nonlocal quantum interactions. Asset-backed systems, on the other hand, are modeled as coherent superpositions that collapse upon use.

This study tests two hypotheses: first, that the number of migrants leaving for OECD countries is influenced by cultural similarities to the host country; and second, that OECD host countries are more likely to accept culturally close migrants. Both hypotheses were tested using the Mann/Whitney U test for 93 countries between 1995 and 2015. The relationship between cultural and geodesic distance also analysed. The results indicate that cultural proximity significantly influences migration patterns, although the impact varies across countries. About two/thirds of OECD countries show a positive correlation between cultural similarity and geographic proximity, with notable exceptions, such as New Zealand and Australia, which exhibit a negative correlation. Countries such as Colombia, Denmark, and Japan maintain cultural distance, even from their neighbouring countries.

This study constructs an aggregated international food supply network based on the trade data of four staple crops and evaluates its structural robustness through network integrity under accumulating external shocks. Network integrity is typically quantified in network science by the relative size of the largest connected component, and we propose a new robustness metric that incorporates both the broadness p and severity q of external shocks. Our findings reveal that the robustness of the network has gradually increased over the past decades, punctuated by temporary declines that can be explained by major historical events. While the aggregated network remains robust under moderate disruptions, extreme shocks targeting key suppliers such as the United States and India can trigger systemic collapse. When the shock broadness p is less than about 0.3 and the shock severity q is close to 1, the structural robustness curves S(p,q) decrease linearly with respect to the shock broadness p, suggesting that the most critical economies have relatively even influence on network integrity. Comparing the robustness curves of the four individual staple foods, we find that the soybean supply network is the least robust. Furthermore, regression and machine learning analyses show that increaseing food (particularly rice and soybean) production enhances network robustness, while rising food prices significantly weaken it.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08857v1", "doi": null}

We derive the market-based portfolio variance and its decomposition by its securities, which accounts for the impact of random trade volumes and is a polynomial of the 4th degree in the variables of the relative amounts invested into the securities. To do that, we transform the time series of market trades with the securities of the portfolio and obtain the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of market trades determine the market-based means and variances of prices and returns of the portfolio in the same form as the means and variances of any market security.

Decades of research have made it clear that technological change produces winners and losers. Machines can replace some types of work that humans do, while new technologies increase human's productivity in other types of work. For a long time, highly educated workers benefitted from increased demand for their labor due to skill-biased technological change, while the losers were concentrated at the bottom of the wage distribution (Katz and Autor, 1999; Goldin and Katz, 2007, 2010; Kijima, 2006). Currently, however, labor markets seem to be affected by a different type of technological change, the so-called routine-biased technological change (RBTC). This chapter studies the risk of automation in developing country labor markets, with a particular focus on differences between men and women. Given the pervasiveness of gender occupational segregation, there may be important gender differences in the risk of automation. Understanding these differences is important to ensure progress towards equitable development and gender inclusion in the face of new technological advances.

This paper explores reasons for these adoption hurdles and tests several service design levers to increase chatbot uptake. We use incentivized online experiments to study chatbot uptake in a variety of scenarios. The results of these experiments are threefold. First, people respond positively to improvements in chatbot performance; however, the chatbot channel is utilized less frequently than expected-time minimization would predict. A key driver of this underutilization is the reluctance to engage with a gatekeeper process, i.e., a process with an imperfect initial service stage and possible transfer to a second, expert service stage -- a behavior we term \"gatekeeper aversion\". We show that gatekeeper aversion can be further amplified by a secondary hurdle, algorithm aversion. Second, chatbot uptake can be increased by providing customers with average waiting times in the chatbot channel, as well as by being more transparent about chatbot capabilities and limitations. Third, methodologically, we show that chatbot adoption can depend on experimental implementation. In particular, chatbot adoption decreases further as (i) stakes are increased, (ii) the human/algorithmic nature of the server is manipulated with more realism. Our results suggest that firms should continue to prioritize investments in chatbot technology. However, less expensive, process-related interventions can also be effective.

Results reveal that, by acting as an exploration-hybrid solution, hybrid technologies maintain a transitionary role by supporting mainly the technological development side of emerging technology.

Furthermore, the dynamic model demonstrates that limited mobility persists both during the transition and in the long run, limiting the labor market's capacity to absorb rapid technological progress.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04047v1", "doi": null}

Through bibliometric analysis, scenario evaluation, legal and regulatory framework analysis and economic modeling, the research examines two key SAF production technologies: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathways in the Brazilian context. The findings reveal significant economic challenges, particularly high feedstock and production costs, which hinder SAF competitiveness with fossil fuels at recent and current market prices in Brazil, leading to the analysis of potential incentives and commercial conditions aiming to increase economic attractiveness of SAF production. Based on interviews with relevant stakeholders and decision makers in the industry, scenarios incorporating tax incentives, carbon credits, capital grants, and premium pricing for SAF and its biogenic by-products demonstrate that combined policy interventions and commercial arrangements, along with a regulated Carbon Market are essential for SAF economic viability. Future research is suggested to look at regional assessments of feedstock availability, supply chain logistics, and global market eligibility.

The current production of rare earth oxides (REOs) is completed by an energy and chemically intensive process from the mining of REE ores. Investigations into a more sustainable supply of REEs from secondary sources, such as toxic phosphogypsum (PG) waste, is vital to securing the REE supply chain. However, conventional solvent extraction to recover dilute REEs from PG waste is inefficient and has high environmental impact. In this work, we propose a treatment train for the recovery of REEs from PG which includes a bio-inspired adsorptive separation to generate a stream of pure REEs, and we assess its financial viability and environmental impacts under uncertainties through a \"probabilistic sustainability\" framework integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA). Results show that in 87% of baseline scenario simulations, the internal rate of return (IRR) exceeded 15%, indicating that this system has the potential to be profitable. However, environmental impacts of the system are mixed. Specifically, the proposed system outperforms conventional systems in ecosystem quality and resource depletion, but has higher human health impacts. Scenario analysis shows that the system is profitable at capacities larger than 100,000 kg*hr-1*PG for PG with REE content above 0.5 wt%. The most dilute PG sources (0.02-0.1 wt% REE) are inaccessible using the current process scheme (limited by the cost of acid and subsequent neutralization) requiring further examination of new process schemes and improvements in technological performance.

This review synthesizes studies published between 2000 and 2024 to reflect current agricultural practices and nutritional challenges. We examine how agricultural practices and time use affect nutritional outcomes among rural women through pathways such as income generation food preparation and intra-household labour allocation. A structured methodology with clear inclusion and exclusion criteria was used to assess gender-sensitive and nutrition-sensitive interventions. Using narrative synthesis the review categorizes findings around key themes and contextual factors including socio-economic status seasonality and labour intensity. The results show that while increased involvement in agriculture can boost household dietary diversity and income it also raises time burdens that affect food preparation childcare and self-care. Positive outcomes occur when interventions enhance women's decision-making power income access and use of time-saving technologies whereas negative outcomes emerge when excessive workloads compromise energy balance and limit rest. A conceptual framework is presented to map the dual pathways linking agriculture time use and nutrition capturing the roles of labour distribution social norms and resource access. The framework underscores the need to integrate gender equity time efficiency and nutritional objectives into agricultural policies.

However, grids based on intermittent renewables are challenged by diurnal and seasonal mismatch between supply of sun and wind and demand for electricity, including for heat pumps and electric two and four wheelers. Load management and demand response measures promise to adjust for this mismatch, utilizing information- and price-based approaches to steer demand towards times with high supply of intermittent renewables. Here, we systematically review the literature estimating CO$_2$ savings from residential load management in developing and developed nations. We find that load management holds high potential, locally differentiated with energy mix (including the respective share of renewables and fossils), climate zone, and the regulatory environment and price mechanism. Most identified studies suggest a mitigation potential between 1 and 20%. Load management becomes more relevant with higher shares of intermittent renewables, and when electricity prices are high. Importantly, load management aligns consumers' financial incentives with climate change mitigation, thus rendering accompanying strategies politically feasible.

The study's primary application focuses on the major coffee exporting sector, utilizing simulation modeling grounded in principles of demand elasticity and substitution to project potential trade flow impacts. Specifically, for coffee, this simulation demonstrates how the proposed tariff differentials can induce significant substitution effects, projecting a potential shift in U.S. import demand away from high-tariff origins toward lower-tariff competitors. This disruption, stemming from the tariffs impacting exporting countries, is projected to ultimately increase coffee prices for consumers in the United States.

MFD reduced on-campus food-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on treated days by 52.9% and contributed to improved fiber (+26.9%) and cholesterol (-4.5%) consumption without altering caloric intake.

By applying weighted ordered logistic regression models, we find that higher engagement predicts greater support for easing legal immigration, even after adjusting for education, gender, age, partisanship, income, urban residence, and generalized social trust. To capture the substantive effect, we visualize predicted probabilities across levels of engagement. In full-sample models, the likelihood of supporting \"a lot harder\" immigration drops from 26% to 13% as engagement rises, while support for \"a lot easier\" increases from 10% to 21%. Subgroup analyses by partisanship show consistent directionality, with notable shifts among Republicans.

Instead of suppressing demand among disadvantaged consumers, our scheme increases supply by involving privileged consumer-providers (prosumers) who under-utilize their resources. This hybrid supply approach maintains high quality-of-service (QoS) for both consumers and prosumers in both normal and surge demand situations without surge pricing. To ensure prosumer QoS, we reserve a small portion of the primary supply to meet their needs if their resources become unavailable during surge periods. As the probability of such events is low compared to that of the surge demand itself, the reserved resources required are minimal. The resulting scheme is resource-efficient, socially progressive, and sustainable, exploiting under-used resources. We illustrate our scheme through two applications: high-range car sharing for owners of small EVs, and shared charging points for EV drivers.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24048v1", "doi": null}

The large land areas required to fulfil the conservation target and the quick schedule of implementation challenge both the current policy instruments and public funding for conservation. We introduce a deferrence mechanism for forest conservation by using procurement auctions. Deferring the conservation payments allows the government to conserve large areas in a quicker schedule and distributing the financial burden of conservation cost for a longer period of time. The deferred payments are paid an interest. The interest earning and an auction mechanism for downpayments strengthens the incentives for landowners to take part in conservation. We characterize the general properties of the mechanism and run numerical simulations to find that the deferrence mechanism facilitates a quick conservation of stands and thereby minimizes the loss of ecologically valuable sites caused by harvesting risks. The analysis suggests that keeping the lending period no longer than 10 years and paying a 3% interest rate provides a compromise that works rather well and outperforms the up-front mechanism in most cases.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23955v1", "doi": null}

This raises an important research question, how will key macroeconomic and related variables for the U.S. forest sector change in the future for highly forest-dependent states? To address this, we employ a vector error correction (VEC) model to forecast economic trends in three major industries - forestry and logging, wood manufacturing, and paper manufacturing - across six of the most forest-dependent states in the U.S.: Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wisconsin. The forecasting results imply that the forestry and logging industry will largely experience decreases in employment and the number of firms. Wood manufacturing has similar findings, but employment is forecasted to increase in general. Paper manufacturing is forecasted to decrease employment, output, and the number of firms, while wages will remain constant. The analysis highlights how timber-based manufacturing communities may be more resilient than other forestry-based industries in the face of economic disruptions. This type of regional forecasting provides valuable insights for regional policy makers and industry stakeholders, helping them anticipate economic shifts and implement strategies to support affected communities. In addition, the methodology applied in this study can be extended to other non-forestry industries that serve as economic pillars for specific regions such as mining, agriculture, and energy production, offering a framework for assessing economic resilience in resource-dependent communities.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "econ.EM", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23569v1", "doi": null}

While this strong individual-level link between homelessness and unemployment is well-documented, the broader impact of labor market dynamics on homelessness remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the impact of local labor market conditions on the duration of homelessness, using individuals' homeless shelter usage records as a proxy for measuring their homelessness duration. Specifically, drawing on Canada's National Homelessness Information System data from 2014 to 2017, we analyze how local employment growth and changes in the local employment rate affect shelter usage duration. Our findings reveal that a 1% increase in local employment is associated with a 0.11-quarter (approximately 0.33-month) reduction in the average duration of shelter usage, while a 1% rise in the local employment rate leads to a 0.34-quarter (approximately 1.02-month) reduction. These changes correspond to decreases of 2.9% and 8.9%, respectively, in the average duration of shelter stays. The findings underscore the critical role of employment opportunities in reducing homelessness and lend support to job-oriented policy interventions for the homeless.

We find that production costs in the US significantly exceed those in China due to higher capital intensity and input costs. Our analysis reveals that a majority of modeled projects in the US are not competitive at current market prices. We identify key cost drivers, including capital costs, economies of scale, and input material prices, and explore pathways to improve the competitiveness of US graphite production, such as supportive financing and process innovation directions. The analysis of conventional graphite production costs at scale also informs ceiling costs for alternative, promising pathways such as methane pyrolysis and catalytic graphitization. This study highlights the challenges and trade-offs in building a diversified graphite supply chain and informs policy and investment decisions.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21521v2", "doi": null}

This study examines the concept of information digestion-the process through which information is accurately understood-and aims to elucidate differences in the information digestion processes of sellers and buyers to clarify the role of product page information. To address this, we conducted two experiments: a questionnaire survey involving 400 subjects and a conjoint analysis with eye-tracking for 15 participants. Initially, we selected eight sample products from four distinct product categories based on the Foote, Cone, and Belding (FCB) grid and compared the product information components considered important by sellers and buyers. Subsequently, we created 12 types of product pages that varied in the combination of four attributes: title, price, product description, and image. Experiment 1 revealed significant differences in the perceived importance of product page components between buyers and sellers. It also demonstrated that product categories and transaction experience influenced the importance assigned to these components, particularly for buyers. Results from Experiment 2 showed that buyers prioritize product descriptions and identified two distinct buyer groups based on their information digestion patterns: one that carefully reads and digests information and another that processes information more rapidly.

Similar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is constrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and practitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations.

Deductible plans have become increasingly common in the United Sates to mitigate escalating healthcare costs. Quantifying the impact of increased cost-sharing from deductibles on utilization is a challenging empirical question because individuals and employers self-select into plans with deductibles. We evaluated the impact of cost-sharing in plans with deductibles by leveraging an accidental injury to a family member as an instrumental variable that strongly predicted the non-injured family member reaching their deductible maximum, which resulted in a reduction in cost-sharing. Our outcome measures examined utilization subject to cost-sharing as compared to utilization exempt from cost-sharing. Using data from the same healthcare system to control for quality and provider network, we found that reaching the deductible increased emergency department (ED) utilization by 10.0 percentage points (pp). Nearly one-quarter of the increased ED utilization was potentially avoidable. Wellness visits not subject to cost-sharing decreased by 5.7 pp. Results were similar for high-deductible plans and for families meeting their maximum out-of-pocket amount.

We find that, first, SSH strategies influence the optimal software strategies by changing the consumers' entry barriers to the ADS market. Specifically, for manufacturers with mature ADS technology, the bundle strategy provides consumers with a lower entry barrier by integrating SSH, making the flexible subscription model a dominant strategy; while perpetual licensing outperforms under the unbundle strategy. Second, the software strategies influence the optimal SSH strategy by altering consumers' exit barriers. Perpetual licensing imposes higher exit barriers; when combined with a bundle strategy that lowers entry barriers, it becomes a more advantageous choice for manufacturers with mature ADS technology. In contrast, the subscription strategy allows consumers to easily exit the market, making the bundle strategy advantageous only when a substantial proportion of consumers are compatible with ADS.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17174v1", "doi": null}

The size of any tree, within an even-aged stand, is taken as a measure of an inherited productive capacity, and then combined with quality thinning. For sparse cultivation density, the result is forestry without commercial thinnings; large trees cannot be removed since they are the most productive, neither small trees because the unit price of harvesting would be large. For large cultivation density, thinning from above becomes combined with quality thinning of large trees. Darwinian spreading of growth rate may correlate with quality. Quality thinning may enhance growth rate. Such effects combined, large trees still become removed but quality thinning becomes implemented in almost all diameter classes. At financial maturity, Darwinian spreading treated with quality thinning, the weighted mean breast height diameter is in the vicinity of 20 cm within stands of high planting density, and somewhat higher with low planting density. Quality correlating with Darwinian spreading of growth, and growth rate correlating with observed quality, trees grow bigger, the maturity size becoming closer to 25 cm - bigger than in earlier studies without tree-size - dependency of vigor.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16906v2", "doi": null}

Growth and development hypotheses have been addressed from many different perspectives. It is aimed to examine the view of production with the Heavy Industry Initiative proposed by Prof. Dr. Necmettin Erbakan a crucial part of Material Development in T\\\"urkiye. In this context, an examination has been conducted on GDP, Mining, Manufacturing, Energy, and Chemical Industry Productions in T\\\"urkiye between 1995-2023, focusing on percentage changes. The stationarity of our data set has been checked, and a VAR estimation has been performed by determining the lag length. Long-term relationships have been identified through the Johansen Cointegration test, and after confirming that there are no issues of autocorrelation and changing variance, variance decomposition has been carried out. Thus, inferences have been made regarding the effects of the identified sectors on GDP. Based on the analysis results, it has been observed that there is a stronger relationship between GDP and the Manufacturing Sector compared to the Mining, Energy, and Chemical Sectors, and it has been concluded that sectoral shocks diminish over time. Additionally, VAR Impulse-Response Analysis has been conducted among the variables. In this context, it has been observed that the variables in the dataset have an impact on each other in both the short and long term. It has been concluded that the shocks were more pronounced in the initial periods, while the economy reached a balance over time. In this regard, it has been confirmed that the heavy industry initiative exhibited different responses sectorally, while also being significant in terms of economic growth and development.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16301v2", "doi": null}

Taking the Zero Hunger Program in Brazil as a case study, this study analyzes the impact of policy changes on the income distribution of the Brazilian population during the implementation of the program using a breakpoint regression approach. The data for the study come from a variety of sources, including the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Social Assistance and the Family, and are analyzed using detailed descriptive statistics from the CEIC Brazil In-Depth Database. The results of the study show that during the Lula administration, Brazil's Zero Hunger Program substantially reduced income inequality, provided more substantial income security for the poor, and reduced the income gap between the rich and the poor. In terms of gender differences, the program led to a larger increase in the income of the male labor force at the right age compared to the female labor force, further highlighting the positive impact of the policy on the male labor force. These results are further confirmed by sensitivity analysis and provide useful lessons for subsequent policy formulation. This study's deep dive into the effects of the Zero Hunger program provides a valuable contribution to academic social science research and policy development.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC", "q-fin.GN"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16126v1", "doi": null}

However, to incorporate natural hazard risk into infrastructure investment decisions, we develop an approach to translate this risk into discount rates. Thus, our newly developed discount rate approach incorporates both economic risk and natural hazard risk. To illustrate the impact of including the risk of natural hazards, we apply country-specific discount rates for hydrogen production costs. The country-specific relative difference in hydrogen generation cost ranges from a 96% surplus in the Philippines to a -63% cost reduction in Kyrgyzstan compared to a discount rate that only consists of economic risks. The inclusion of natural hazard risk changes the cost ranking of technologies as outcome of energy system models and thus policy recommendations. The derived discount rates for 254 countries worldwide are published in this publication for further use.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16009v1", "doi": null}

Using only pre-merger data, we propose a reduced-form approach that leverages exogenous changes in market structure to forecast merger effects. Finally, we use structural prospective merger simulations with our other estimates for a comprehensive evaluation. This bridging of approaches uncovers a fundamental tension: either efficiency gains were limited or, if they were significant, they were accompanied and offset by coordinated effects.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15785v2", "doi": null}

The empirical analysis results show that: at the direct level, the development of environmental liability insurance has the effect of reducing industrial carbon emissions, and its effect is heterogeneous. At the indirect level, the role of environmental liability insurance is weaker in areas with developed financial industry and underdeveloped financial industry. Further heterogeneity analysis shows that in the industrial developed areas, the effect of environmental liability insurance on carbon emissions is more obvious. Based on this, countermeasures and suggestions are put forward from the aspects of expanding the coverage of environmental liability insurance, innovating the development of environmental liability insurance and improving the level of industrialization.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC", "q-fin.GN"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15445v1", "doi": null}

This study investigates the effectiveness of fiscal policies in mitigating these impacts, focusing on government interventions such as spending, subsidies, revenue, and debt. Utilizing a Markov Switching Vector Auto regression (MS-VAR) model, the study examines data from 2000 to 2023, considering three economic regimes: the initial shock, the peak crisis, and the recovery phase. The results indicate that the COVID-19 shock led to a sharp decline in household consumption and income in all three countries, with Slovenia facing the most severe immediate impact. Hungary, however, showed the strongest recovery, driven by effective fiscal measures such as subsidies and increased government spending, which significantly boosted both household consumption and income. The Czech Republic demonstrated a more gradual recovery, with improvements observed in future-oriented consumption (IMPC). In conclusion, the study underscores the critical role of targeted fiscal interventions in mitigating the adverse effects of crises. The findings suggest that governments should prioritize timely and targeted fiscal policies to support household financial stability during economic downturns and ensure long-term recovery.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15584v1", "doi": null}
