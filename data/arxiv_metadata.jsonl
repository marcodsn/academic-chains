In many cases the performance of the nervous system is so good that it apporaches fundamental physical limits, such as the limits imposed by diffraction and photon shot noise in vision. In this paper we show how to use the language of statistical field theory to address and solve problems in signal processing, that is problems in which one must estimate some aspect of the environment from the data in an array of sensors. In the field theory formulation the optimal estimator can be written as an expectation value in an ensemble where the input data act as external field. Problems at low signal-to-noise ratio can be solved in perturbation theory, while high signal-to-noise ratios are treated with a saddle-point approximation. These ideas are illustrated in detail by an example of visual motion estimation which is chosen to model a problem solved by the fly's brain. In this problem the optimal estimator has a rich structure, adapting to various parameters of the environment such as the mean-square contrast and the correlation time of contrast fluctuations. This structure is in qualitative accord with existing measurements on motion sensitive neurons in the fly's brain, and we argue that the adaptive properties of the optimal estimator may help resolve conlficts among different interpretations of these data.

In the framework of the lattice model we build a database of model proteins by a) picking randomly 200 lattice chain conformations; b) designing sequences which fold into these structures with some arbitrary ``true'' potential; c) use this database for extracting a potential; d) fold model proteins using the extracted potential. This test on the model system showed that our procedure is able to recover the potential with correlation $r \\approx 91\\%$ with the ``true'' one and we were able to fold all model structures using the recovered potential. Other statistical knowledge-based approaches were tested using lattice models and the results indicate that they also can recover the ``true'' potential with high degree of accuracy.

At first we explore these relations on a global scale over the time period 1990--2008 focusing on two different dimensions of inequality: the capital share of income and a Theil measure of wage inequality. In both cases, the movement of inequality follows a pattern similar to the one theorized by Kuznets in the fifties. We then narrow down the object of study ad we concentrate on wage inequality within the United States. By employing data on wages and employment on the approximately 3100 US counties for the time interval 1990--2014, we generalize the Fitness-Complexity algorithm for counties and NAICS sectors, and we investigate wage inequality between industrial sectors within counties. At this scale, in the early nineties we recover a behavior similar to the global one. While, in more recent years, we uncover a trend reversal: wage inequality monotonically increases as industrialization levels grow. Hence at a county level, at net of the social and institutional factors that differ among countries, we not only observe an upturn in inequality but also a change in the structure of the relation between wage inequality and development.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03133v1", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0182774"}

Consistent with economic theory, the analysis finds a negative relationship between electricity prices in California and regional trade, conditional on local demand. Each 1 gigawatt-hour increase in California electricity imports is associated with an average $0.15 per megawatt-hour decrease in the California Independent System Operator's wholesale electricity price. There is a net-negative short term relationship between carbon dioxide emissions in California and electricity imports that is partially offset by positive emissions from exporting neighbors. Specifically, each 1 GWh increase in regional trade is associated with a net 70-ton average decrease in CO2 emissions across the western U.S., conditional on demand levels. The results provide evidence that electricity imports mostly displace natural gas generation on the margin in the California electricity market. A small positive relationship is observed between short-run SO2 and NOx emissions in neighboring regions and California electricity imports.

In a field experiment conducted over a 29 week period on individuals wearing Fitbit activity trackers, we find modest and short lived increases in physical activity for those provided the choice of aggressive incentives. In contrast, we find significant and persistent increases for those assigned (oftentimes against their stated preference) to the same aggressive incentives. The modest benefits for those provided a choice seems to emerge because those who benefited most from the aggressive incentives were the least likely to choose them, and it was those who did not need them who opted in. These results are confirmed in a follow up lab experiment. We also find that benefits to individuals assigned to aggressive incentives were pronounced if they also updated their step target in the Fitbit mobile application to match the new activity goal we provided them.

It operationalizes the DNN interpretability in the choice analysis by formulating the metrics of interpretation loss as the difference between true and estimated choice probability functions. This study also uses the statistical learning theory to upper bound the estimation error of both prediction and interpretation losses in DNN, shedding light on why DNN does not have the overfitting issue. Three scenarios are then simulated to compare DNN to binary logit model (BNL). We found that DNN outperforms BNL in terms of both prediction and interpretation for most of the scenarios, and larger sample size unleashes the predictive power of DNN but not BNL. DNN is also used to analyze the choice of trip purposes and travel modes based on the National Household Travel Survey 2017 (NHTS2017) dataset. These experiments indicate that DNN can be used for choice analysis beyond the current practice of demand forecasting because it has the inherent utility interpretation, the flexibility of accommodating various information formats, and the power of automatically learning utility specification. DNN is both more predictive and interpretable than BNL unless the modelers have complete knowledge about the choice task, and the sample size is small. Overall, statistical learning theory can be a foundation for future studies in the non-asymptotic data regime or using high-dimensional statistical models in choice analysis, and the experiments show the feasibility and effectiveness of DNN for its wide applications to policy and behavioral analysis.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10465v2", "doi": null}

Using an experimental simulation game, we examined human participant's willingness to invest in biosecurity when confronted with disease outbreak scenarios. We varied the scenarios by changing the information provided about 1) disease incidence and 2) biosecurity strategy or response by production facilities to the threat of disease. Here we show that willingness to invest in biosecurity increases with increased information about disease incidence, but decreases with increased information about biosecurity practices used by nearby facilities.

Overwhelming evidence shows that choice is stochastic, which has given rise to random utility models as the dominant paradigm in applied microeconomics. However, as is well known, it is not possible to infer the structure of preferences in the absence of assumptions on the structure of noise. This makes it impossible to empirically test the structure of noise independently from the structure of preferences. Here, we show that the difficulty can be bypassed if data sets are enlarged to include response times. A simple condition on response time distributions (a weaker version of first order stochastic dominance) ensures that choices reveal preferences without assumptions on the structure of utility noise. Sharper results are obtained if the analysis is restricted to specific classes of models. Under symmetric noise, response times allow to uncover preferences for choice pairs outside the data set, and if noise is Fechnerian, even choice probabilities can be forecast out of sample. We conclude by showing that standard random utility models from economics and standard drift-diffusion models from psychology necessarily generate data sets fulfilling our sufficient condition on response time distributions.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02497v1", "doi": null}

To explain the network structure, a preferential weight assignment process is proposed as an adaptation of the classical preferential attachment process to weighted directed networks. The network structure is strongly predicted by this process where historical technological linkages and proximities matter, while human capital flows and economic input-output flows have conflicting effects on link formation.

These channel choices are the result of a recursive process of social interactions and determine the observable trading networks. They are characterized by feedback mechanisms due to peer interaction and therefore need to be understood as complex adaptive systems (CAS). When modelling CAS, conventional approaches like regression analyses face severe drawbacks since endogeneity is omnipresent. As an alternative, process-based analyses allow researchers to capture these endogenous processes and multiple feedback loops. This paper applies an agent-based modelling approach (ABM) to the empirical example of the Indonesian rubber trade. The feedback mechanisms are modelled via an innovative approach of a social matrix, which allows decisions made in a specific period to feed back into the decision processes in subsequent periods, and allows agents to systematically assign different weights to the decision parameters based on their individual characteristics. In the validation against the observed network, uncertainty in the found estimates, as well as under determination of the model, are dealt with via an approach of evolutionary calibration: a genetic algorithm finds the combination of parameters that maximizes the similarity between the simulated and the observed network. Results indicate that the sellers' channel choice decisions are mostly driven by physical distance and debt obligations, as well as peer-interaction.
