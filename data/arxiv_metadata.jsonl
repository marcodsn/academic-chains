The neuronal network is composed of many Hebbian autoassociators, or modules, each of which interacts with a relatively small number of the others. Every module encodes and stores a number of elementary percepts, or features. Memory items, or patterns, are peculiar combinations of features sparsely distributed over the multi-modular network. Any feature stored in any module can be involved in several of the stored patterns; feature-sharing is in fact source of local ambiguities and, consequently, a potential cause of erroneous memory retrieval activity spreading through the model network.   The memory retrieval dynamics of the large multi-modular autoassociator is investigated by means of quantitative analysis and numerical simulations. An oscillatory retrieval process is found to be very efficient in overcoming feature-sharing drawbacks; it requires a mechanism that modulates the robustness of local attractors to noise, and neuronal activity sparseness such that quiescent and active modules are about equally noisy. Correlated activation of interconnected modules and extramodular neuronal contacts more effective than the intramodular ones seem to be general requirements in order to efficiently achieve satisfactory quality of memory retrieval. It is also shown that, even in ideal conditions, some spots of the network cannot be reached by retrieval activity spread. The locations of these activity isles depend on the pattern to retrieve and on the cue, while their extension only depends on architecture of the graph and statistics of the stored patterns. The existence of these isles determines an upper-bound to retrieval quality that does not depend on the specific retrieval dynamics adopted, nor on whether feature-sharing is permitted. The oscillatory retrieval process nearly saturates this bound.", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "physics.bio-ph", "q-bio", "q-bio.NC"], "primary_category": "cond-mat.dis-nn", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0107612v3", "doi": "10.1023/B:JCNS.0000023871.60959.88"}

In many cases, the bacterial activity returns to its pre-stimulus level exactly and this \"perfect adaptability\" is robust against variations in various chemotaxis protein concentrations. We model the bacterial chemotaxis signaling pathway, from ligand binding to CheY phosphorylation. By solving the steady-state equations of the model analytically, we derive a full set of conditions for the system to achieve perfect adaptation. The conditions related to the phosphorylation part of the pathway are discovered for the first time, while other conditions are generalization of the ones found in previous works. Sensitivity of the perfect adaptation is evaluated by perturbing these conditions. We find that, even in the absence of some of the perfect adaptation conditions, adaptation can be achieved with near perfect precision as a result of the separation of scales in both chemotaxis protein concentrations and reaction rates, or specific properties of the receptor distribution in different methylation states. Since near perfect adaptation can be found in much larger regions of the parameter space than that defined by the perfect adaptation conditions, their existence is essential to understand robustness in bacterial chemotaxis.", "categories": ["physics.bio-ph", "physics.chem-ph", "q-bio"], "primary_category": "physics.bio-ph", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0211094v2", "doi": "10.1016/S0006-3495(03)70021-6"}

The present work reports on how recent results from complex network formalism can be used to quantify and model the effect of topographical connections between neuronal cells over a number of relevant network properties such as connectivity, adjacency, and information broadcasting. While the topographical mapping between two cortical modules are achieved by connecting nearest cells from each module, three kinds of network models are adopted for implementing intracortical connections (ICC), including random, preferential-attachment, and short-range networks.

Several important features emerge: 1) A pressure amplification occurs as otoconia enter a narrowing duct; 2) An average-sized otoconium requires approximately five seconds to settle through the wide ampulla, where $\\Delta P_c$ is not amplified, which suggests a mechanism for the observed latency of BPPV; and 3) An average-sized otoconium beginning below the center of the cupula can cause a volumetric cupular displacement on the order of 30 pL, with nystagmus of order $2^\\circ$/s, which is approximately the threshold for sensation. Larger cupular volume displacement and nystagmus could result from larger and/or multiple otoconia.", "categories": ["physics.flu-dyn", "physics.med-ph", "q-bio"], "primary_category": "physics.flu-dyn", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0305100v2", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbiomech.2003.12.014"}

It is well understood now that a loop embedded in a chain is characterized by a loop closure exponent c which is higher than that of an isolated loop. Here we report an analysis of DNA melting curves for sequences of a broad range of lengths (from 10 to 10^6 base pairs) calculated with a program based on the algorithms underlying MELTSIM. Using the embedded loop exponent we find that the cooperativity parameter is one order of magnitude bigger than current estimates.

Our model suggests that the map in heterozygotes is single-valued in the temporal region of retina due to reduced gradient of ephrin in the corresponding region of SC. The remaining map is double-valued since the gradient of ephrin is high there. We predict therefore that if gradient of ephrin is reduced by a genetic manipulation, the single-valued region of the map should occupy a larger portion of temporal retina, i.e. the point of transition between single- and doulble-valued maps should move to a more nasal position in Isl2-EphA3 heterozygotes.

This phenomenon is hereby recognized as a nontrivial heteropolymer property capable of providing fundamental insight into protein energetics. Many current protein chain models, including common lattice and continuum G\\=o models with explicit native biases, fail to reproduce this generic protein property. Here we show that simple two-state kinetics is obtainable from models with a cooperative interplay between core burial and local conformational propensities or an extra strongly favorable energy for the native structure. These predictions suggest that intramolecular recognition in real two-state proteins is more specific than that envisioned by common G\\=o-like constructs with pairwise additive energies. The many-body interactions in the present kinetically two-state models lead to high thermodynamic cooperativity as measured by their van't Hoff to calorimetric enthalpy ratios, implying that the native and denatured conformational populations are well separated in enthalpy by a high free energy barrier. Consistent with experiments, comparison among the present models with extra native favorabilities indicate that their folding rate at a given interaction strength decreases with increasing native contact order, although the dependence is weaker than the corresponding trend in real proteins. It has been observed experimentally that deviations from Arrhenius behavior are often more severe for folding than for unfolding.

We use a generating functional technique to derive analytical expressions for the order parameters at the first time step ($t=1$) and the second time step ($t=2$). We find that the overlap between the target pattern and the state of the network at $t=1$ is independent of the symmetry of the additional random part of the synaptic interaction matrix. The result may have bearing on the theories which use the results at $t=1$ to estimate quantities relevant to the retrieval performance of the network. The symmetry of the synaptic interaction matrix becomes effective from the second time step, explicitly through a correlation function involving spin configurations at different times. This suggests that the prediction of the long time behavior of the network from the first few time steps may not be {\\it always} correct. This was confirmed by the numerical simulation which shows that the difference in the long time and the short time behavior of the network becomes pronounced in presence of asymmetry in the synaptic interaction matrix. It is also found in simulations that the size of the basins of attraction of the stored patterns decreases with an increase in the asymmetry. Moreover, the convergence time for the retrieval increases. These results are contrary to the expectations from the earlier studies based on the counting of fixed points. However, the convergence time for the spurious fixed points increases faster than that for the retrieval fixed points in the presence of asymmetry in the synapses.

The densities of the ions adsorbed on the phosphate strands, in the major and in the minor grooves are calculated. First, we find that the adsorption pattern on the DNA surface depends strongly on its geometrical shape: counterions adsorb preferentially along the phosphate strands for a cylindrical model shape, but in the minor groove for a geometrically structured model. Second, we find that an addition of monovalent salt ions results in an increase of the charge density in the minor groove while the total charge density of ions adsorbed in the major groove stays unchanged. The adsorbed ion densities are highly structured along the minor groove while they are almost smeared along the major groove. Furthermore, for a fixed amount of added salt, the major groove cationic charge is independent on the counterion valency. For increasing salt concentration the major groove is neutralized while the total charge adsorbed in the minor groove is constant. DNA overcharging is detected for multivalent salt.

Nevertheless, applications such as evolutionary theory demand consideration of precisely this aspect of information, a need that has motivated a largely unsuccessful search for a suitable measure of an \"amount of meaning\". This paper represents an attempt to move beyond this impasse, based on the observation that the meaning of a message can only be understood relative to its receiver. Positing that the semantic value of information is its usefulness in making an informed decision, we define pragmatic information as the information gain in the probability distributions of the receiver's actions, both before and after receipt of a message in some pre-defined ensemble. We then prove rigorously that our definition is the only one that satisfies obvious desiderata, such as the additivity of information from logically independent messages. This definition, when applied to the information \"learned\" by the time evolution of a process, defies the intuitions of the few previous researchers thinking along these lines by being monotonic in the uncertainty that remains after receipt of the message, but non-monotonic in the Shannon entropy of the input ensemble. It then follows that the pragmatic information of the genetic \"messages\" in an evolving population is a global Lyapunov function for Eigen's quasi-species model of biological evolution.

However, the storage capacity of the entire network then decreases. To overcome this difficulty, we propose decreasing the connecting rate while keeping the total number of synapses constant by introducing delayed synapses. In this paper, a discrete synchronous-type model with both delayed synapses and their prunings is discussed as a concrete example of the proposal. First, we explain the Yanai-Kim theory by employing the statistical neurodynamics. This theory involves macrodynamical equations for the dynamics of a network with serial delay elements. Next, considering the translational symmetry of the explained equations, we re-derive macroscopic steady state equations of the model by using the discrete Fourier transformation. The storage capacities are analyzed quantitatively. Furthermore, two types of synaptic prunings are treated analytically: random pruning and systematic pruning. As a result, it becomes clear that in both prunings, the storage capacity increases as the length of delay increases and the connecting rate of the synapses decreases when the total number of synapses is constant. Moreover, an interesting fact becomes clear: the storage capacity asymptotically approaches $2/\\pi$ due to random pruning. In contrast, the storage capacity diverges in proportion to the logarithm of the length of delay by systematic pruning and the proportion constant is $4/\\pi$. These results theoretically support the significance of pruning following an overgrowth of synapses in the brain and strongly suggest that the brain prefers to store dynamic attractors such as sequences and limit cycles rather than equilibrium states.", "categories": ["cond-mat.dis-nn", "q-bio"], "primary_category": "cond-mat.dis-nn", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305517v1", "doi": null}

A second example will come from gene finding using sequence data from one or two species, where generalized HMMs or generalized pair HMMs have proved to be very effective.", "categories": ["math.PR", "q-bio", "60J20, 92C40"], "primary_category": "math.PR", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0304372v1", "doi": null}

At a given interaction strength, this scheme leads to folding rates that are logarithmically well correlated with CO (correlation coefficient $r=0.914$) and span more than 2.5 orders of magnitude, whereas folding rates of the corresponding G\\=o models with additive contact energies have much less logarithmic correlation with CO and span only approximately one order of magnitude.

Restricting to perfect immunization in two spatial dimensions we analyze the phase diagram and study the scaling behavior along the phase transition line as well as in the vicinity of the GEP point.

We first consider a single pair of filaments, and show that when values of parameters such as the lever-arm displacement and the crossbridge elasticity are chosen to provide effective energy transduction, the T2 curve (the tension recovered immediately after a step displacement) displays a region of negative slope. If filament compliance and the discrete nature of the binding sites are taken into account, the negative slope is diminished, but not eliminated. This implies that there is an instability in the dynamics of individual half-sarcomeres. However, when the symmetric nature of whole sarcomeres is taken into account, filament rearrangement becomes important during the transient: as tension is recovered, some half-sarcomeres lengthen while others shorten. This leads to a flat T2 curve, as observed experimentally. In addition, we investigate the isotonic transient response and show that for a range of parameter values the model displays damped oscillations, as recently observed in experiments on single muscle fibers.

In the first model, sixteen biochemical reactions involved in transcription, translation and transcriptional regulation in the presence of inducer molecules are considered. The time evolution of the number of biomolecules of a particular type is determined using the stochastic simulation method based on the Gillespie Algorithm. The results obtained show that if the number of inducer molecules, N(I), is greater than or equal to the number of regulatory molecules, N(R), the average protein level is high in the steady state (state 2). The magnitude of the level is the same as long as N{I) greater than or equal to N(R). When N(I) is very very less than N(R), the average protein level is low, practically zero (state 1). As N(I) increases, the protein level continues to remain low. When N(I)becomes close to N(R), protein levels in the steady state are intermediate between high and low.In the presence of autocatalysis, a cell mostly exists in either state 1 or state 2 giving rise to a bimodal distribution in the protein levels in an ensemble of cells. This corresponds to the \"all or none'' phenomenon observed in experiments. In the second model, the inducer molecules are not considered explicitly. An exhaustive simulation over the parameter space of the model shows that there are three major patterns of gene expression, Type A, Type B and Type C. The effect of varying the cellular parameters on the patterns, in particular, the transition from one type of pattern to another, is studied. Type A and Type B patterns have been observed in experiments.

The model emphasizes the effects of branching and capping on the density of free filament ends. The variants differ in their treatment of side vs. end branching and dimensionality, and assume that new branches are generated by existing branches (autocatalytic behavior) or independently of existing branches (nucleation behavior). In autocatalytic models, the network growth velocity is rigorously independent of the opposing force exerted by the obstacle, and the network density is proportional to the force. The dependence of the growth velocity on the branching and capping rates is evaluated by a numerical solution of the rate equations. In side-branching models, the growth velocity drops gradually to zero with decreasing branching rate, while in end-branching models the drop is abrupt. As the capping rate goes to zero, it is found that the behavior of the velocity is sensitive to the thickness of the branching region.

We develop statistical alpha contact potential. A studentized bootstrap method is then introduced for assessing the 95% confidence intervals for each of the 210 parameters. We found with confidence that there is significant long range propensity (>30 residues apart) for hydrophobic interactions. We test alpha contact potential for native structure discrimination using several decoy sets, and found it often has comparable performance with atom-based potentials requiring more parameters. We also show that alpha contact potential has better performance than potential defined by cut-off distance between geometric centers of side chains. Clustering of alpha contact potentials reveals natural grouping of residues. To explore the relationship between shape representation and physicochemical representation, we test the minimum alphabet size for structure discrimination. We found that there is no significant difference in discrimination when alphabet size varies from 7 to 20, if geometry is represented accurately by alpha simplicial edges.

Despite the importance of this quantity, there are no general formulation of R0 when one considers the spread of a disease in a generic finite population, involving, for instance, arbitrary topology of inter-individual interactions and heterogeneous mixing of susceptible and immune individuals. The goal of this work is to study this concept in a generalized stochastic system described in terms of global and local variables.

A class of widely used potentials for coarse grained models of proteins are contact potentials in the form of weighted linear sum of pairwise contacts. However, these potentials have been shown to be unsuitable choices because they cannot stabilize native proteins against a large number of decoys generated by gapless threading. We develop an alternative framework for designing protein potential. We describe how finding optimal protein potential can be understood from two geometric viewpoints, and we derive nonlinear potentials using mixture of Gaussian kernel functions for folding and design. The optimization criterion for obtaining parameters of the potential is to minimize bounds on the generalization error of discriminating protein structures and decoys not used in training. In our experiment we use a training set of 440 protein structures repre senting a major portion of all known protein structures, and about 14 million structure decoys and sequence decoys obtained by gapless threading. We succeeded in obtaining nonlinear potential with perfect discrimination of the 440 native structures and native sequences. For the more challenging task of sequence design when decoys are obtained by gapless threading, we show that there is no linear potential with perfect discrimination of all 440 native sequences.

Several distinct stages in the translocation process are identified, characterized by changes in polymer conformation and by variations in the magnitude and direction of the internal electric field induced by the fluctuating charge distribution.

These sequences have landscapes that are only weakly funneled in the conventional thermodynamic sense, but have unusually low kinetic barriers for reconfigurational motion. Traps have been specifically removed by selection. Here we examine the possibility of folding on these \"buffed\" landscapes, by mapping the determination of statistics of pathways for the heterogeneous nucleation processes involved in escaping from traps to the solution of an imaginary time Schroedinger equation. This equation is solved analytically in adiabatic and ``soft-wall'' approximations, and numerical results are shown for the general case.

With these results a conclusion on the probable role of the telomeric pattern on aging has also been drawn. Here the calculated values of harmonic frequencies of the telomeric pattern of bases and of other possible patterns show that the telomeric pattern is associated with the highest vibrational frequency among all patterns of base combinations at the replication end of DNA. This seems to suggest that due to the existing telomeric pattern being closest to the frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation coming from sunlight, resonance of the telomeric frequency with such radiation may be responsible for damage to the reproductive ability of the cells and consequent aging and other problems. On the other hand in the last part of this work we have calculated the thermal vibrational amplitudes of the telomeric pattern and other possible patterns which show that the amplitude for the telomeric pattern is the least, and this suggests that the telomeric pattern is more mechanically and thermally stable than other possible patterns in the biological environment against damage from ordinary heat and mechanical effects.", "categories": ["physics.bio-ph", "physics.chem-ph", "q-bio"], "primary_category": "physics.bio-ph", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0301031v1", "doi": null}

This imprint may give rise to long-range mechanical forces mediated by the elasticity of the membrane. Calculating the resulting many-body interaction between a collection of inserted dynamins and a membrane bud, we find a regime in which the dynamins are elastically recruited by the bud to form a collar around its neck, which is reminiscent of the actual process preempting vesicle scission.

We find that there exist two meaningful fractions of links connected, $p_m$ and $p_s$, where the number of clusters becomes maximum and the connectivity distribution follows a power law, respectively. Interestingly, one of clusters at $p_m$ contains a high density of essential genes having almost the same functionality. Thus the deletion of all genes belonging to that cluster can lead to lethal inviable mutant efficiently. Such an essential cluster can be identified in a self-organized way. Once we measure the connectivity of each gene at $p_s$. Then using the property that the essential genes are likely to have more connectivity, we can identify the essential cluster by finding the one having the largest mean connectivity per gene at $p_m$.", "categories": ["cond-mat.stat-mech", "q-bio"], "primary_category": "cond-mat.stat-mech", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0301110v1", "doi": null}

We further demonstrate that protein-like scaling relationship between packing density and chain length is observed in off-lattice self-avoiding walks. A key problem in studying compact chain polymer is the attrition problem: It is difficult to generate independent samples of compact long self-avoiding walks. We develop an algorithm based on the framework of sequential Monte Carlo and succeed in generating populations of compact long chain off-lattice polymers up to length $N=2,000$. Results based on analysis of these chain polymers suggest that maintaining high packing density is only characteristic of short chain proteins.

The systemic risk of supply chains can be quantified and is closely related to the topology and dynamics of supply chain networks (SCN). How different network properties contribute to this risk remains unclear. Here, we ask whether systemic risk can be significantly reduced by strategically rewiring supplier-customer links. In doing so, we understand the role of specific endogenously emerged network structures and to what extent the observed systemic risk is a result of fundamental properties of the dynamical system. We minimize systemic risk through rewiring by employing a method from statistical physics that respects firm-level constraints to production. Analyzing six specific subnetworks of the national SCNs of Ecuador and Hungary, we demonstrate that systemic risk can be considerably mitigated by 16-50% without reducing the production output of firms. A comparison of network properties before and after rewiring reveals that this risk reduction is achieved by changing the connectivity in non-trivial ways. These results suggest that actual SCN topologies carry unnecessarily high levels of systemic risk.

These traditions underscore the vital role of value diversity in fostering social trust, institutional legitimacy, and long-term prosperity. EthosGPT addresses the challenge of value homogenization by introducing an open-source framework for mapping and evaluating LLMs within a global scale of human values.

We utilize data from three nationally representative opinion polls conducted by the Pew Research Center between 2021 and 2023, and employ Bayesian techniques to estimate the ordinal probit and ordinal quantile models. Results from ordinal probit show that respondents who are well-informed about EVs, perceive them as environmentally beneficial, or are confident in development of charging stations are more likely to express strong interest in buying an EV, with covariate effects--a metric rarely reported in EV research--of 10.2, 15.5, and 19.1 percentage points, respectively. In contrast, those skeptical of government climate initiatives are more likely to express no interest, by more than 10 percentage points. Prior EV ownership exhibits the highest covariate effect (ranging from 19.0 to 23.1 percentage points), and the impact of most demographic variables is consistent with existing studies. The ordinal quantile models demonstrate significant variation in covariate effects across the distribution of EV purchase intent, offering insights beyond the ordinal probit model.

The second condition $-$ a global optimal tax formula $-$ provides a representation that balances the local costs and benefits of optimal taxation while explicitly accounting for global incentive constraints. Second, we use Legendre transformations to represent our problem as a linear program. This linearization allows us to solve the model quantitatively and to precisely characterize bunching. At an optimum, 10 percent of workers is bunched. We introduce two notions of bunching $-$ blunt bunching and targeted bunching. Blunt bunching constitutes 30 percent of all bunching, occurs at the lowest regions of cognitive and manual skills, and lumps the allocations of these workers resulting in a significant distortion. Targeted bunching constitutes 70 percent of all bunching and recognizes the workers' comparative advantage.

Currently, however, labor markets seem to be affected by a different type of technological change, the so-called routine-biased technological change (RBTC). This chapter studies the risk of automation in developing country labor markets, with a particular focus on differences between men and women. Given the pervasiveness of gender occupational segregation, there may be important gender differences in the risk of automation. Understanding these differences is important to ensure progress towards equitable development and gender inclusion in the face of new technological advances. Our objective is to describe the gender gap in the routine task intensity of jobs in developing countries and to explore the role of occupational segregation and several worker characteristics in accounting for the gender gap.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07689v1", "doi": null}

This paradigm shifts challenges traditional team dynamics, requiring new interaction protocols, delegation strategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. Drawing on Team Situation Awareness (SA) theory, we identify two critical gaps in current human-AI teaming research: the difficulty of aligning AI agents with human values and objectives, and the underutilization of AI's capabilities as genuine team members. Addressing these gaps, we propose a structured research outlook centered on four key aspects of human-AI teaming: formulation, coordination, maintenance, and training. Our framework highlights the importance of shared mental models, trust-building, conflict resolution, and skill adaptation for effective teaming.

Government debt can transmit risks to local banks, which are among the primary holders of local debt, thereby triggering systemic financial risks. Consequently, exploring debt resolution pathways and evaluating the systematic effects of debt servicing policies has become critically important. This study employs panel data from 348 local commercial banks across 29 provincial-level administrative regions in China from 2010 to 2023, and constructs a difference-in-differences (DID) model to investigate the impact of the State Council's special supervision of debt servicing on local bank risks. The findings indicate that the government's debt servicing policy essentially represents a shift of government debt from explicit to implicit forms, significantly increasing the risks faced by local banks and producing outcomes contrary to the policy's original intent. This effect is particularly pronounced for rural commercial banks and banks with high customer concentration and fewer branches. Mechanism analysis reveals two key insights. First, local banks are heavily influenced by local government control; the government's debt servicing requires banks to support the government by purchasing government bonds and other financial instruments, which leads to a deterioration in asset quality and an expansion of risk exposure. Second, government debt crowds out private credit from local banks, weakening the region's repayment capacity and ultimately increasing bank risk. Our research uncovers the counterintuitive effects of government debt servicing and offers corresponding policy recommendations.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13423v2", "doi": null}

This paper explores reasons for these adoption hurdles and tests several service design levers to increase chatbot uptake. We use incentivized online experiments to study chatbot uptake in a variety of scenarios. The results of these experiments are threefold. First, people respond positively to improvements in chatbot performance; however, the chatbot channel is utilized less frequently than expected-time minimization would predict. A key driver of this underutilization is the reluctance to engage with a gatekeeper process, i.e., a process with an imperfect initial service stage and possible transfer to a second, expert service stage -- a behavior we term \"gatekeeper aversion\". We show that gatekeeper aversion can be further amplified by a secondary hurdle, algorithm aversion. Second, chatbot uptake can be increased by providing customers with average waiting times in the chatbot channel, as well as by being more transparent about chatbot capabilities and limitations. Third, methodologically, we show that chatbot adoption can depend on experimental implementation. In particular, chatbot adoption decreases further as (i) stakes are increased, (ii) the human/algorithmic nature of the server is manipulated with more realism. Our results suggest that firms should continue to prioritize investments in chatbot technology. However, less expensive, process-related interventions can also be effective. These may include being more transparent about the types of queries that are (or are not) suitable for chatbots, emphasizing chatbot reliability and quick resolution times, as well as providing faster live agent access to customers who experienced chatbot failure.", "categories": ["cs.HC", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC", "94", "J.4"], "primary_category": "cs.HC", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06145v1", "doi": null}

We propose to focus on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and aim at providing an entrance to the literature as an invitation to mathematicians that are potentially interested in such a project.   From our point of view, mathematics has been partly misused in mainstream economics to justify `unregulated markets'. We identify two key parts of CME, which leads to a natural structure of this article: The first part focusses on an analysis and critique of mathematical models used in mainstream economics, like e.g. the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) in Macroeconomics and the so-called ``Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu''-Theorems.   The aim of the second part is to improve and extend heterodox models using ingredients from modern mathematics and computer science, a method with strong relation to Complexity Economics.

The current production of rare earth oxides (REOs) is completed by an energy and chemically intensive process from the mining of REE ores. Investigations into a more sustainable supply of REEs from secondary sources, such as toxic phosphogypsum (PG) waste, is vital to securing the REE supply chain. However, conventional solvent extraction to recover dilute REEs from PG waste is inefficient and has high environmental impact. In this work, we propose a treatment train for the recovery of REEs from PG which includes a bio-inspired adsorptive separation to generate a stream of pure REEs, and we assess its financial viability and environmental impacts under uncertainties through a \"probabilistic sustainability\" framework integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA). Results show that in 87% of baseline scenario simulations, the internal rate of return (IRR) exceeded 15%, indicating that this system has the potential to be profitable. However, environmental impacts of the system are mixed. Specifically, the proposed system outperforms conventional systems in ecosystem quality and resource depletion, but has higher human health impacts. Scenario analysis shows that the system is profitable at capacities larger than 100,000 kg*hr-1*PG for PG with REE content above 0.5 wt%. The most dilute PG sources (0.02-0.1 wt% REE) are inaccessible using the current process scheme (limited by the cost of acid and subsequent neutralization) requiring further examination of new process schemes and improvements in technological performance. Overall, this study evaluates the sustainability of a first-of-its-kind REE recovery process from PG and uses these results to provide clear direction for advancing sustainable REE recovery from secondary sources.", "categories": ["physics.soc-ph", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "physics.soc-ph", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10495v1", "doi": null}

This review synthesizes studies published between 2000 and 2024 to reflect current agricultural practices and nutritional challenges. We examine how agricultural practices and time use affect nutritional outcomes among rural women through pathways such as income generation food preparation and intra-household labour allocation. A structured methodology with clear inclusion and exclusion criteria was used to assess gender-sensitive and nutrition-sensitive interventions. Using narrative synthesis the review categorizes findings around key themes and contextual factors including socio-economic status seasonality and labour intensity. The results show that while increased involvement in agriculture can boost household dietary diversity and income it also raises time burdens that affect food preparation childcare and self-care. Positive outcomes occur when interventions enhance women's decision-making power income access and use of time-saving technologies whereas negative outcomes emerge when excessive workloads compromise energy balance and limit rest. A conceptual framework is presented to map the dual pathways linking agriculture time use and nutrition capturing the roles of labour distribution social norms and resource access. The framework underscores the need to integrate gender equity time efficiency and nutritional objectives into agricultural policies.

This might be different with other load and generation scenarios, but the BZR data is important as it was created to make a decision about splits of the existing bidding zones. Nodal pricing rules lead to the lowest total cost. We also evaluate differences of nodal pricing rules with respect to the necessary uplift payments, which is relevant in the context of the current discussion on non-uniform pricing in the EU. While the study focuses on Germany, the analysis is relevant beyond and feeds into the broader discussion about pricing rules in non-convex markets.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09265v5", "doi": null}

We conduct one of the first large-scale experimental assessments of four LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemma 3, and LLaMA 3.3) across two complementary experiments. In the first, we use nonparametric binscatter and linear regression techniques to analyze over 29,000 evaluations of 1,220 anonymized papers drawn from 110 economics journals excluded from the training data of current LLMs, along with a set of AI-generated submissions. The results show that LLMs consistently distinguish between higher- and lower-quality research based solely on textual content, producing quality gradients that closely align with established journal prestige measures. Claude and Gemma perform exceptionally well in capturing these gradients, while GPT excels in detecting AI-generated content. The second experiment comprises 8,910 evaluations designed to assess whether LLMs replicate human like biases in single blind reviews. By systematically varying author gender, institutional affiliation, and academic prominence across 330 papers, we find that GPT, Gemma, and LLaMA assign significantly higher ratings to submissions from top male authors and elite institutions relative to the same papers presented anonymously. These results emphasize the importance of excluding author-identifying information when deploying LLMs in editorial screening.

MFD reduced on-campus food-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on treated days by 52.9% and contributed to improved fiber (+26.9%) and cholesterol (-4.5%) consumption without altering caloric intake. These nutritional benefits were, however, accompanied by a 27.6% decrease in protein intake and a 34.2% increase in sugar consumption. Moreover, the increase in plant-based meals did not carry over to subsequent days, as evidenced by a 3.5% rebound in animal-based meal consumption on days immediately following treated days. MFD also led to a 16.8% drop in on-campus meal sales on treated days.Monte Carlo simulations suggest that if 8.7% of diners were to eat burgers off-campus on treated days, MFD's GHG savings would be fully negated.

By applying weighted ordered logistic regression models, we find that higher engagement predicts greater support for easing legal immigration, even after adjusting for education, gender, age, partisanship, income, urban residence, and generalized social trust. To capture the substantive effect, we visualize predicted probabilities across levels of engagement. In full-sample models, the likelihood of supporting \"a lot harder\" immigration drops from 26% to 13% as engagement rises, while support for \"a lot easier\" increases from 10% to 21%. Subgroup analyses by partisanship show consistent directionality, with notable shifts among Republicans. Social trust and education are also consistently associated with more open attitudes, while older respondents tend to support less lenient pathways to legal immigration policies.

Second, the two-level NL model captures individuals' decision on EV adoption behavior distinguished by vehicle transaction type and EV type, where the upper level yields the vehicle transaction type selected from the set of alternatives including no-transaction, sell, trade, and add.

In such markets, the market operator makes side payments to generators to cover lost opportunity costs, and CH prices minimize the total \"lost opportunity costs\", which include both actual losses and missed profit opportunities. These prices can also be obtained by solving a (partial) Lagrangian dual of the original mixed-integer program, where power balance constraints are dualized. Computing CH prices then amounts to minimizing a sum of nonsmooth convex objective functions, where each term depends only on a single generator. The subgradient of each of those terms can be obtained independently by solving smaller mixed-integer programs. In this work, we benchmark a large panel of first-order methods to solve the above dual CH pricing problem. We test several dual methods, most of which not previously considered for CH pricing, namely a proximal variant of the bundle level method, subgradient methods with three different stepsize strategies, two recent parameter-free methods and an accelerated gradient method combined with smoothing. We compare those methods on two representative sets of real-world large-scale instances and complement the comparison with a (Dantzig-Wolfe) primal column generation method shown to be efficient at computing CH prices, for reference.

Leveraging variation in law implementation across localities over time and between same-sex and different-sex couples, we find that anti-discrimination laws not only significantly narrow gaps in labor force participation and employment for male same-sex couples relative to men in different-sex couples, but also boost their percentile rank in the wage distribution. Our analysis reveals mostly null effects for female same-sex couples; however, in metropolitan areas these laws significantly reduce their employment compared to women in different-sex couples. One explanation for the reduced labor supply is that female same-sex couples begin to have more children in response to the laws.

In India, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system acts as implicit crop insurance, shielding farmers from price drops without premium payments. We analyze the impact of climate on price volatility for soybean (Madhya Pradesh), rice (Assam), and cotton (Gujarat). Using ERA5-Land reanalysis data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, we analyze historical climate patterns and evaluate two scenarios: SSP2.4.5 (moderate case) and SSP5.8.5 (severe case). Our findings show that weather conditions strongly influence price fluctuations and that integrating meteorological data into volatility models enhances risk-hedging. Using the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model, we estimate conditional price volatility and identify cross-correlations between weather and price volatility movements. Recognizing MSP's equivalence to a European put option, we apply the Black-Scholes model to estimate its implicit premium, quantifying its fiscal cost.

Moreover, most researchers agree, that trust between actors is key for successful data sharing activities. However, existing research oftentimes focus on trust from a data provider perspective. Therefore, our work highlights the unbalanced view of trust, addressing it from a data consumer perspective. More specifically, our aim is to investigate trust enhancing measures on a data level, that is data trustworthiness. We found, that existing data trustworthiness enhancing solutions do not meet the requirements of the domain of inter-organisational data sharing. Therefore, our study addresses this gap. Conducting a rigorous design science research approach, this work proposes a new Levels of Assurance for Data Trustworthiness artifact. Built on existing artifacts, we demonstrate, how it addresses the identified challenges within the domain appropriately. We found that our novel approach requires more work to be suitable for adoption. Still, we are confident that our solution can increase consumer trust.

This hybrid supply approach maintains high quality-of-service (QoS) for both consumers and prosumers in both normal and surge demand situations without surge pricing. To ensure prosumer QoS, we reserve a small portion of the primary supply to meet their needs if their resources become unavailable during surge periods. As the probability of such events is low compared to that of the surge demand itself, the reserved resources required are minimal. The resulting scheme is resource-efficient, socially progressive, and sustainable, exploiting under-used resources.

We introduce a deferrence mechanism for forest conservation by using procurement auctions. Deferring the conservation payments allows the government to conserve large areas in a quicker schedule and distributing the financial burden of conservation cost for a longer period of time. The deferred payments are paid an interest. The interest earning and an auction mechanism for downpayments strengthens the incentives for landowners to take part in conservation. We characterize the general properties of the mechanism and run numerical simulations to find that the deferrence mechanism facilitates a quick conservation of stands and thereby minimizes the loss of ecologically valuable sites caused by harvesting risks.

This raises an important research question, how will key macroeconomic and related variables for the U.S. forest sector change in the future for highly forest-dependent states? To address this, we employ a vector error correction (VEC) model to forecast economic trends in three major industries - forestry and logging, wood manufacturing, and paper manufacturing - across six of the most forest-dependent states in the U.S.: Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wisconsin. The forecasting results imply that the forestry and logging industry will largely experience decreases in employment and the number of firms. Wood manufacturing has similar findings, but employment is forecasted to increase in general. Paper manufacturing is forecasted to decrease employment, output, and the number of firms, while wages will remain constant. The analysis highlights how timber-based manufacturing communities may be more resilient than other forestry-based industries in the face of economic disruptions. This type of regional forecasting provides valuable insights for regional policy makers and industry stakeholders, helping them anticipate economic shifts and implement strategies to support affected communities. In addition, the methodology applied in this study can be extended to other non-forestry industries that serve as economic pillars for specific regions such as mining, agriculture, and energy production, offering a framework for assessing economic resilience in resource-dependent communities.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "econ.EM", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23569v1", "doi": null}

Specifically, drawing on Canada's National Homelessness Information System data from 2014 to 2017, we analyze how local employment growth and changes in the local employment rate affect shelter usage duration. Our findings reveal that a 1% increase in local employment is associated with a 0.11-quarter (approximately 0.33-month) reduction in the average duration of shelter usage, while a 1% rise in the local employment rate leads to a 0.34-quarter (approximately 1.02-month) reduction. These changes correspond to decreases of 2.9% and 8.9%, respectively, in the average duration of shelter stays. The findings underscore the critical role of employment opportunities in reducing homelessness and lend support to job-oriented policy interventions for the homeless.

While DSGE models traditionally rely on rational expectations, we demonstrate that behavioral expectations more accurately capture the distributional characteristics of India's output gap and inflation rates data. Utilizing both Hodrick-Prescott and Kalman filters, we estimate the output gap and establish congruence with the moments of the simulated output gap. Concurrently, employing the initial negative demand shock values of the output gap, we calibrate the persistence parameters of negative aggregate demand (AD) and positive aggregate supply (AS) shocks, alongside the initial magnitude of the positive supply shock to achieve correspondence with post-COVID actual average values of the output gap and inflation rate. To ensure model precision, we implement Mahalanobis distance minimization for model calibration. Our findings elucidate that vaccination programs generated significant positive supply shocks, counterbalancing the prolonged negative demand shock precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the positive supply shocks' persistence parameter exceeds that of the negative demand shocks, indicating the exceptional efficacy of India's vaccination strategy. Furthermore, this research advances the scholarly contributions of Dasgupta and Rajeev (2023) by furnishing a quantitative DSGE framework that complements their static simple Keynesian analysis.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17165v3", "doi": null}

To complement existing feature extraction techniques, this paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models to model audience forward-looking beliefs about how stories might unfold. Our method generates multiple potential continuations for each story and extracts features related to expectations, uncertainty, and surprise using established content analysis techniques. Applying our method to over 30,000 book chapters, we demonstrate that our framework complements existing feature engineering techniques by amplifying their marginal explanatory power on average by 31%.

To address this, we conducted two experiments: a questionnaire survey involving 400 subjects and a conjoint analysis with eye-tracking for 15 participants. Initially, we selected eight sample products from four distinct product categories based on the Foote, Cone, and Belding (FCB) grid and compared the product information components considered important by sellers and buyers.

Experiment 1 revealed significant differences in the perceived importance of product page components between buyers and sellers. It also demonstrated that product categories and transaction experience influenced the importance assigned to these components, particularly for buyers. Results from Experiment 2 showed that buyers prioritize product descriptions and identified two distinct buyer groups based on their information digestion patterns: one that carefully reads and digests information and another that processes information more rapidly.

The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap between theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing research in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning while offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.", "categories": ["cs.GT", "cs.CL", "cs.HC", "cs.MA", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "cs.GT", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22726v1", "doi": null}

Deductible plans have become increasingly common in the United Sates to mitigate escalating healthcare costs. Quantifying the impact of increased cost-sharing from deductibles on utilization is a challenging empirical question because individuals and employers self-select into plans with deductibles. We evaluated the impact of cost-sharing in plans with deductibles by leveraging an accidental injury to a family member as an instrumental variable that strongly predicted the non-injured family member reaching their deductible maximum, which resulted in a reduction in cost-sharing. Our outcome measures examined utilization subject to cost-sharing as compared to utilization exempt from cost-sharing. Using data from the same healthcare system to control for quality and provider network, we found that reaching the deductible increased emergency department (ED) utilization by 10.0 percentage points (pp). Nearly one-quarter of the increased ED utilization was potentially avoidable. Wellness visits not subject to cost-sharing decreased by 5.7 pp. Results were similar for high-deductible plans and for families meeting their maximum out-of-pocket amount. These findings provide causal evidence that individuals enrolled in plans with deductibles change utilization patterns after an exogenous reduction in cost-sharing.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19992v1", "doi": null}

However, the potential tendency is observed towards owning AV as a private asset rather than using SAV. This calls for a research on investigating individuals' attitude towards AV in comparison with SAV to recognize the barriers to the public's tendency towards SAV. To do so, the present study proposes a modeling framework based on the theories in behavioral psychology to explain individuals' preference for owning AV over using SAV, built as a latent (subjective) psychometric construct, by three groups of explanatory latent constructs including: (i) desire for searching for benefits, i.e., extrinsic motive manifested in utilitarian beliefs; (ii) tendency towards seeking pleasure and joy, i.e., intrinsic motive reflected in hedonic beliefs; and (iii) attitude towards three configurations of shared mobility, i.e., experience with car and ridesharing, bikesharing, and public transit. Estimated on a sample dataset from the State of California, the findings can shed initial lights on the psychological determinants of the public's attitude towards owning AV versus using SAV, which can furthermore provide policy implications intriguing for policy makers and stakeholders. Of note, the findings reveal the strongest influential factor on preference for AV over SAV as hedonic beliefs reflected in perceived enjoyment.

With the advancement of data sensing and control technologies, the reliability of ADS and the purchase intentions of consumers are continually evolving, presenting challenges for manufacturers in promotion and pricing decisions. To address this issue, we develop a two-stage game-theoretical model to characterize the decision-making processes of manufacturers and consumers before and after a technology upgrade. Considering the unique structural characteristics of ADS, which consists of driving software and its supporting hardware (SSH), we propose different business strategies for SSH (bundle or unbundle with the vehicle) and driving software (perpetual licensing or subscription) from the manufacturer's perspective. We find that, first, SSH strategies influence the optimal software strategies by changing the consumers' entry barriers to the ADS market. Specifically, for manufacturers with mature ADS technology, the bundle strategy provides consumers with a lower entry barrier by integrating SSH, making the flexible subscription model a dominant strategy; while perpetual licensing outperforms under the unbundle strategy. Second, the software strategies influence the optimal SSH strategy by altering consumers' exit barriers. Perpetual licensing imposes higher exit barriers; when combined with a bundle strategy that lowers entry barriers, it becomes a more advantageous choice for manufacturers with mature ADS technology. In contrast, the subscription strategy allows consumers to easily exit the market, making the bundle strategy advantageous only when a substantial proportion of consumers are compatible with ADS.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17174v1", "doi": null}

Rotation ages, timber stocks and maturity diameters are not much affected by quality thinning. Bare land valuation neither changes the contribution of the quality thinning. The reason for the small effect apparently lies in the value development of individual trees. The relative value development of small pulpwood trunks is large, since the harvesting expense per volume unit is reduced along with size increment. Such trees are not feasible objects for quality thinning, unless quality correlates with growth rate. Another enhanced stage of value development is when pulpwood trunks turn to sawlog trunks. For large pulpwood trunks, quality thinning is feasible. Existing sawlog content in trees dilutes the effect of quality thinning on the financial return.

The results indicate that the COVID-19 shock led to a sharp decline in household consumption and income in all three countries, with Slovenia facing the most severe immediate impact. Hungary, however, showed the strongest recovery, driven by effective fiscal measures such as subsidies and increased government spending, which significantly boosted both household consumption and income.

Well-established financial procedures appear to be complicated, and lead to partially biased results. Probability theory is applied, and the focus is on the finances of simple periodic growth processes, in the absence of intermediate divestments. The expected value of the profit rate, derived from accounting measures on an accrual basis, does not depend on the capitalization path. The expected value of capitalization is path dependent. Because of the path-dependent capitalization, the return rate on capital is path-dependent, and the time-average return rate on capital differs from the expected value of the return rate on capital for the growth cycle. The internal rate of return, defined through a compounding equation, is path-independent, thereby differing from the expected value of the rate of return on capital. It is shown that within a production estate, the area-average of internal rate of return is not representative of the rate of return on capital. The growth cycle length maximizing the return rate on equity is independent of market interest rate.

This paper introduces Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) as a method for topic modeling with LLMs. It integrates three key components: (1) retrieval, enabling automatized access to external data beyond an LLM's pre-trained knowledge; (2) generation, leveraging LLM capabilities for text synthesis; and (3) agent-driven learning, iteratively refining retrieval and query formulation processes. To empirically validate Agentic RAG for topic modeling, we reanalyze a Twitter/X dataset, previously examined by Mu et al. (2024a). Our findings demonstrate that the approach is more efficient, interpretable and at the same time achieves higher reliability and validity in comparison to the standard machine learning approach but also in comparison to LLM prompting for topic modeling.

Our analysis takes advantage of the high spatiotemporal daily data resolution coming from an unprecedented longitudinal micro-Big Data (GPS and PING records) to make comparisons of small intervention areas, while controlling for common daily trends, deterrence (spatial and temporal), and diffusion; to show that an average police crackdown causes a 35% decrease in violent crime occurrences. There are diminishing returns of public safety to hours spent by police in a single area, corroborating what police officers know well from their own experience and discretionary behavior.

The residual deterrence cancels the relocation of the crime, and the intervention does not generate significant temporal displacement. In addition, we do not find spatial displacement from crime in blocks up to 1.5 km from a blitz. This type of micropolicing tactics generates deterrence by being highly visible in a street segment for a short period and intermittently quasirandom in space-time, which produces uncertainty that might be crucial in minimizing the temporal and spatial displacement of crime.

However, these techniques often falter in high-dimensional, non-linear models that demand more comprehensive approaches. This paper demonstrates that global solutions of economic models with substantial heterogeneity and frictions can be computed accurately and swiftly by augmenting Dynare with adaptive sparse grids (SGs) and high-dimensional model representation (HDMR). SGs mitigate the curse of dimensionality, as the number of grid points grows significantly slower than in traditional tensor-product Cartesian grids. Additionally, adaptivity focuses grid refinement on regions with steep gradients or non-differentiabilities, enhancing computational efficiency. Complementing SGs, HDMR tackles large state spaces by approximating policy functions with a hierarchical expansion of low-dimensional terms. Using a time iteration algorithm, we benchmark our approach on an international real business cycle model. Our results show that both SGs and HDMR alleviate the curse of dimensionality, enabling accurate solutions for at least 100-dimensional models on standard hardware in relatively short times. This advancement extends Dynare's capabilities beyond perturbation approaches, establishing a versatile platform for sophisticated non-linear models and paving the way for integrating the most recent global solution methods, such as those from machine learning.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11464v1", "doi": null}

However, while potential emission reduction motivates the introduction and enforcement of these regulations, realization of this potential does not obfuscate the need for prudent economic policy. Scrutinizing nearly two decades of climate regulations in the transportation, industrial, and electric power sector, we enumerate their associated cost effectiveness. Our findings are twofold. Firstly, we find that whereas there are instances where climate regulations carry net economic benefits, there are also cases where compliance costs substantially exceed the social cost of carbon (SCC). Aggregated across sectors and subject to the precise SCC leveraged, up to 65 percent of climate regulations have abatement costs that exceed the SCC. This exceedance is particularly profound in the transportation sector where up to 82 percent of regulations reviewed have abatement costs that exceed the SCC. Secondly, we find that whereas the economic benefits of climate regulations generally exceed the economic costs, this exceedance is largely contingent on the presence of non-climate benefits. Aggregated across sectors, climate benefits account for 33 percent of overall benefits associated with a regulation, compared to 18, 46, and 2 percent for public health, private, and other benefits respectively. Furthermore, we document instances where climate benefits account for as little as 1.6 percent of overall regulatory benefits. This finding hints at a regulatory inefficiency and raises the prospect that alternative, non-climate specific regulation may be a more appropriate mechanism for realizing the non-climate benefits associated with these regulations. Collectively, our findings challenge the economic pragmatism of some (but not all) climate regulations adopted by the United States over a period of nearly two decades.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11406v1", "doi": null}

This has sparked debate on whether pricing algorithms may tacitly collude to set supra-competitive prices without being explicitly designed to do so. Our study addresses these concerns by examining the risk of collusion when Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are used to decide on pricing strategies in competitive markets. Prior research in this field focused on Tabular Q-learning (TQL) and led to opposing views on whether learning-based algorithms can result in supra-competitive prices. Building on this, our work contributes to this ongoing discussion by providing a more nuanced numerical study that goes beyond TQL, additionally capturing off- and on- policy Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, two distinct families of DRL algorithms that recently gained attention for algorithmic pricing. We study multiple Bertrand oligopoly variants and show that algorithmic collusion depends on the algorithm used. In our experiments, we observed that TQL tends to exhibit higher collusion and price dispersion. Moreover, it suffers from instability and disparity, as agents with higher learning rates consistently achieve higher profits, and it lacks robustness in state representation, with pricing dynamics varying significantly based on information access. In contrast, DRL algorithms, such as PPO and DQN, generally converge to lower prices closer to the Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we show that when pre-trained TQL agents interact with DRL agents, the latter quickly outperforms the former, highlighting the advantages of DRL in pricing competition. Lastly, we find that competition between heterogeneous DRL algorithms, such as PPO and DQN, tends to reduce the likelihood of supra-competitive pricing.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11270v1", "doi": null}

Fairness is fundamental to stimulate cooperation in large populations, and plays an important role in traffic engineering, as it increases the well-being of users, improves driving safety by rule-adherence, and overcomes public resistance at legislative implementation. Despite the importance of fairness, only a few works have translated fairness into the transportation domain, with a focus on transportation planning rather than traffic engineering. Moreover, existing works in traffic engineering discuss fairness superficially and insufficiently, focussing on only a few definitions. The mission of this work is (i) to challenge the efficiency-driven engineering paradigm of traffic engineering, (ii) to establish a link to modern fairness theories, and (iii) to highlight the importance of fairness when allocating scarce, public good, mobility resources between road users. To achieve this, a mode-agnostic, distributive fairness framework for mobility resource allocation is proposed. It serves when designing traffic engineering solutions, and convinces in public debates with a useful, argumentative tool-set to confront equity considerations. Ultimately, this enables systematic research and design of fairness-informed control systems, demonstrated by three case studies on signalized intersection management and static road pricing.", "categories": ["econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "econ.GN", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01309v2", "doi": null}

The increasing dominance of grant-supported research in shaping scientific advances, coupled with growing interest in funding interdisciplinary work, raises fundamental questions about the effectiveness of interdisciplinary grants in fostering high-impact interdisciplinary research outcomes. Here, we quantify the interdisciplinarity of both research grants and publications, capturing 350,000 grants from 164 funding agencies across 26 countries and 1.3 million papers that acknowledged their support from 1985 to 2009. Our analysis uncovers two seemingly contradictory patterns: Interdisciplinary grants tend to produce interdisciplinary papers, which are generally associated with high impact. However, compared to disciplinary grants, interdisciplinary grants on average yield fewer papers and interdisciplinary papers they support tend to have substantially reduced impact. We demonstrate that the key to explaining this paradox lies in the power of disciplinary grants in propelling high-impact interdisciplinary research. Specifically, our results show that highly interdisciplinary papers supported by deeply disciplinary grants garner disproportionately more citations, both within their core disciplines and from broader fields. Moreover, disciplinary grants, particularly when combined with other similar grants, are more effective in producing high-impact interdisciplinary research. Amidst the rapid rise of support for interdisciplinary work across the sciences, these results highlight the hitherto unknown role of disciplinary grants in driving crucial interdisciplinary advances, suggesting that interdisciplinary research requires deep disciplinary expertise and investments.", "categories": ["cs.DL", "cs.SI", "econ.GN", "q-fin.EC"], "primary_category": "cs.DL", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14732v3", "doi": null}

We test this idea in the context of a major climate policy: Germany's Heating Law of 2023, which mandates the phase-out of fossil fuel heating. Through a survey experiment with property owners, we examine whether providing comprehensive information about the regulation's costs, requirements, and timeline affects adoption decisions and policy support. Despite successfully increasing factual knowledge, information provision has no significant effect on intended technology adoption, policy support, or incentivized measures of climate preferences. Instead, pre-existing environmental preferences and demographic characteristics emerge as the key predictors of responses to the regulation. A feeling that existing systems still work well and cost considerations dominate fossil fuel users' stated reasons for non-adoption, while independence from fossil fuels and perceived contributions to the common good drive adoption among switchers. Our findings suggest that opposition to climate policy stems from fundamental preference heterogeneity rather than information frictions. This has important implications for optimal policy design, highlighting potential limits of information provision in overcoming resistance to environmental regulation.

This phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii)~the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\\propto \\sqrt{Q}$. In this Letter, we propose an exactly solvable model of the nonlinear price-impact dynamics that unifies these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable L\\'evy-walk model. Our exact solution and numerical simulations reveal three important points: First, the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under the long-range correlation. Second, price-movement statistics follows truncated power laws with typical exponent around three. Third, volatility has long memory. While this simple model lacks adjustable free parameters, it naturally aligns even with other enigmatic empirical laws, such as (iii)~the inverse-cubic law for price statistics and (iv)~volatility clustering.
